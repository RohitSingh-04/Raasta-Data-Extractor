Abstract
There are records of about 400 plants of therapeutic value in the Sikkim Himalaya. Indiscriminate and non-systematic collection
of medicinal plants has led to severe pressure on the availability of these plants, many of which are now rare, threatened or
endangered. Six species, are taken as a case study, viz. Aconitum heterophyllum (Wall), Podophyllum hexandrum (Royle), Nardos-
tachys jatamansi (DC), Picrorhiza kurrooa (Benth), Swertia chirata (Ham) and Bergenia ciliata (Har.) Stenb. The number of plants
collected from the wild in Sikkim are very high (c. 800,000 A. heterophyllum; 7,700,000 N. jatamansi; 3,100,000 P. kurrooa, and
3,000,000 S. chirata). The six species studied are considered as test cases for successful conservation for the large number of species
in Sikkim that are claimed to have therapeutic value and whose survival in the wild is threatened. # 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

1. Introduction
In the Himalayan region the use of plants to cure/
abate certain ailments and disease is an age-old practice
starting from a situation when life-saving herbs from the
wild provided the only refuge during emergency and
trauma. The most ancient Indian system of Ayurvedic
medicine goes back to 1000 BC. A great many of these
traditional medicinal plants have found their way as raw
materials into modern bio-pharmaceuticals and bio-
cosmetic industries in recent times. The World Health
Organization has estimated that about 4000 million
people rely on herbal medicines and 25% of prescrip-
tion drugs are based on plant-derived chemicals.
Careful exploitation of medicinal plants growing in
mountain regions provide an opportunity for local
development (Purohit, 1997). Earlier, such herbals were
used only by local people in small quantities but com-
mercialization of some species in recent years has
increased their demands and consequent exploitation.
Heavy extraction of these plants from the wild, loss of
habitat by deforestation and excessive grazing pressure
in high altitude pastures in the entire Himalayan region
now threaten their survival.
Sikkim remained largely unexplored for a consider-
able period in history because of its geography, but
from the middle of the 18th Century AD visits by nat-
uralists and explorers exposed its biological wealth. It is
now known as a biological `Hot Spot' and about 5000
species of ¯owering plants are found in the 7096 km2
area (Hajra and Verma, 1996). The ®rst ¯oristic study of
the Sikkim Himalaya was by J.D. Hooker (1871±1897),
and this was followed by a comprehensive work on
medicinal plants of Darjeeling and Sikkim by Biswas
(1956). Over 400 plants possessing therapeutic proper-
ties have been recorded from the region (Srivastava and
Kapaki, 1990). Studies on the status, uses and potentials
of 40 important medicinal plants of the Sikkim Hima-
laya were made by Rai and Sharma (1994). Many uses
of Sikkim's medicinal plants in Ayurvedic and Tibetan
medicines, their status and cultivation techniques have
been carefully recorded (Nautiyal, 1995; Sharma, et al.
1995; Singh, 1995; Trogawa et al., 1995; Tsarong, 1995).
Six important species of medicinal plants have been
selected for a study of conservation threats in Sikkim.
This paper deals with the distribution, usage, harvest
pressure and threats concerning Aconitum heterophyllum
(Wall),
Nardostachys
jatamansi
(DC),
Podophyllum
hexandrum (Royle), Picrorhiza kurrooa (Benth), Swertia
chirata (Ham) and Bergenia ciliata (Har) Stenb. The
®rst four species are endangered (Nayar and Sastry,
1990). These selected species are considered as test cases

for successful conservation of the very large number of
species in Sikkim that are claimed to have therapeutic
value and whose survival in the wild is threatened.
2. Sikkim Himalaya
Sikkim Himalaya is de®ned by the great drainage
region of the river Tista that constitutes the hills of Sikkim
and Darjeeling district of West Bengal in the eastern
Himalaya. The hills of Sikkim (7096 km2) and Darjeeling
(3149 km2) range altitudinally from 100 m a.s.l. (foot-
hills) through 4000 m (timberline) up to 8548 m (Mt.
Khangchendzonga). The area thus covers several ecolo-
gical zones viz., subtropical, temperate, sub-alpine and
alpine. In such a small area sharp climatic dierences in
dierent ecological zones have promoted a rich ¯ora.
Sikkim Himalaya is also a cornucopia of ethnicity
having four major groups, Bhutias, Lepchas, Limbus
and Nepalese, and a conglomerate of over 20 ethnic
tribes and even more sub-tribes. The medicinal plants
here are extracted by the local people for ethnic medic-
inal use, for use in Ayurvedic and Tibetan medicines
and also for use in modern bio-pharmaceuticals and
bio-cosmetics. The distribution of the selected six med-
icinal plants is presented in Fig. 1. Swertia chirata
occurs at middle altitude while the other ®ve species
grow at high altitudes.
3. Distribution and usage
3.1. Aconitum heterophyllum (Wall) (Ranunculaceae)
An erect, rarely twining, herb distributed in the tem-
perate Himalaya between Kashmir to Sikkim and fur-
ther east to Myanmar. In the Sikkim Himalaya it is
found around 3500 m. The dried root is used generally for
fever and body pain. It is also used as alterative, dia-
phoretic, diuretic, expectorant, febrifuge and diapepsiac.
3.2. Podophyllum hexandrum (Royle) (Berberidaceae)
A succulent erect herb distributed in the Himalaya
from Afghanistan and south-west China. In the Sikkim
Himalaya it grows between 3600 and 4800 m a.s.l. The
roots are used as emetic, cholagogue, vermifuge, purga-
tive, alterative and blood puri®er. The roots contain
podophyllotoxin, which has been reported as anti-
cancerous (Arnold, 1979).
3.3. Nardostachys jatamansi (DC) (Valerianaceae)
A herb growing up to 20 cm in height. It is found in the
Himalaya between Kumaon and Sikkim. In the Sikkim
Himalaya it is found at an elevation of 3600±4800 m.
The roots are used generally as a stimulant and anti-
spasmodic. Murty and Subramanyam (1989) cited many
other uses such as diuretic and anticonvulsant, and used
in epilepsy, hysteria, heart palpitation and cholera.
Roots are reported to be rich in terpenoids (Wargner
and Jurick, 1979).
3.4. Swertia chirata (Ham) (Gentianaceae)
A slender, upright herb occurring in the Himalaya
from Kashmir to Bhutan and Khasi hills. In the Sikkim
Himalaya it is found between 1600 and 2600 m a.s.l.
The whole plant contains gentiamine alkaloids and the
aerial part contains xanthones (Sharma, 1982). The
water extract of the plant is generally used during fever.
Other uses are in bronchial asthma, dyspepsia and
debility. It is a favourite remedy in intermittent fevers,
acidity and in bilious dyspepsia accompanied by fever.
3.5. Bergenia ciliata (Har) Stenb. (Saxifragaceae)
A creeping herb with rhizomes. It occurs commonly
throughout temperate Himalaya between 1500 and 3000
m. The rhizome is used to cure diarrhea and vomiting.
It is also used against fever, coughs and pulmonary
infections, for boils and as an antiscorbic.
3.6. Picrorhiza kurrooa (Benth) (Scrophulariaceae)
A creeping herb found between Kashmir and Sikkim
above 4000 m. Its roots are used as a tonic, cathartic,
stomachic and purgative. It is also used in fever, dys-
pepsia
and
scorpion
stings.
Glycosides,
especially
picroside and kutkoside, are the chief bioactive phyto-
chemicals of its roots (Aswal et al., 1984).
4. Conservation threats
So far all the medicinal plants that reach the common
market are collected from the wild state. The majority
of
traders
collect
wild
medicinal
plants
through
untrained and unskilled labourers. This is generally in
the form of extraction of the entire plants, roots, rhi-
zomes, tubers and bulbs before seed set, making low
regeneration of the species in the habitat. Over-exploi-
tation of these species, as well as trampling at particular
places during collection has changed the habitat condi-
tions causing a gradual loss of other associated species.
The market stock of medicinal plants comes from
private collectors and suppliers with legal permits for
collection of herbs from speci®c collection sites. These
sites are demarcated and collection permits issued by
the Forest Department, Government of Sikkim. Major
medicinal herbs are scattered throughout the region,
but some sites are identi®ed for pro®table collection.
28
L.K. Rai et al. / Biological Conservation 93 (2000) 27±33
A collection cycle is maintained every year under rota-
tion so that the same sites are not exploited repeatedly.
Although this system has de®nite bene®t to the con-
servation of these herbals it is not strictly followed.
Absence of forest ocials at remote sites allows collec-
tors to enter sites other than the demarcated ones and
there is a great deal of illegal collecting that cannot be
measured from market investigations.
The collection season for the major species is shown
in Fig. 2, and the major collection sites are cited in
Table 1. After collection all the materials are brought to
the respective road-heads and then transported to the
markets at Gangtok, Siliguri, Kalimpong and other
destinations such as Calcutta and New Delhi. The
pricing and transaction of amount involved is kept
strictly secret. Even the actual destination of the

shipment is not known as dealers maintain a guarded
attitude towards relevant inquiries.
A general herbal inventory from a typical jadi-buti
salesman is presented in Table 2. The ®nal product may
be sold as raw, unprocessed or under-processed (in the
form of twigs, leaves, barks, roots and rhizomes) or in
the form of processed powder, crude tablets or syrups.
In general, the plant parts suitable for the marketing
purpose increase with maturity; one can get better eco-
nomic returns with the fully matured plants and this is
dictated by a regular market demand. However, most of
these species take 7±8 years to attain full maturity and
to become economically viable (Nautiyal, 1995), which
can severely test the patience of herbal farmers. The
resultant option, thus remains, direct collection of the
herbs from the wild state. The amount collected for a
calendar year from the dierent collection centres in
Sikkim is given in Table 1. Comparison of collections
and harvesting pressures in Sikkim and Nepal clearly
shows that the situation is even worse in Nepal, espe-
cially for P. kurrooa and S. chirata (Table 3). The
extraction pressure, in terms of number of plants, for a
single calendar year is very high for almost all the spe-
cies. Average yields are given in Table 4. This shows the
approximate number of plants which are required
(shoot or root dry mass) to produce 1 kg of medicinal
part. A. heterophyllum, for example requires a total of
75 plants uprooted from the nature to realize 1 kg.
Likewise, plant numbers required for every kilogram are
highest in P. kurrooa followed by N. jatamansi, S. chir-
ata, B. ciliata and lowest in P. hexandrum. Except for
S. chirata only the underground parts are marketable.

In any case the volume of biomass taken out every year
from the wild state in the form of medicinal herbs has
been quite remarkable. Total plant numbers harvested
annually from Sikkim is given in Table 4. These num-
bers are very high and suggest heavy harvesting pressure
on their natural habitats indicating a high and steady
biomass loss every year.
5. Conservation initiatives
In the Sikkim Himalaya, research and development
on conservation of medicinal plants are being carried
out by the G.B. Pant Institute of Himalayan Environ-
ment and Development, the Forest Department and
other agencies (Table 5). Propagation techniques for
Aconitum,
Picrorhiza
and
Podophyllum
have
been
developed using seeds or cuttings of stems, stolons,
tubers and rhizomes (Nautiyal, 1995). The Forest and
Horticulture Departments have established a nursery
for growing high altitude medicinal plants, but sus-
tained cropping has not yet been successfully achieved.
So far, no local agencies have taken measures for
systematic cultivation and marketing of these herbs.
However, works on protection, conservation and man-
agement, along with an awareness drive among medic-
inal plant collectors, have been initiated by the Forest
Department. A policy of rotational harvesting from
demarcated areas through permits allows recuperation
and a sustainable harvest. Most of the medicinal plants
occur in restricted areas of the state and collection per-
mits are only issued to local inhabitants. This has
restrained collectors from outside the area who are
normally very numerous in the central Himalaya. The
Forest Department has also been planting some of these
medicinal plants back into natural habitats to see whe-
ther sustainable harvesting in demarcated areas can
meet the requirements for traditional use. The remain-
ing areas in the wild should be set aside for in situ
conservation by banning exploitation there. Another

possible approach is through community involvement in
sustainable use. An enterprise at Humla in Nepal pro-
vides a success story for conserving N. jatamansi and its
habitat. Local people harvest the roots of this species
from nearby alpine meadows using minimum dis-
turbance and taking only the largest plants, process
them on-site and export the oil through the Humla
Conservation and Development Association (Biodi-
versity Conservation Network, 1997).
