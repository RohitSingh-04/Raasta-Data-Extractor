SUMMARY 
The rich plant diversity of the Indian Himalaya is utilized by the native communities in 
various forms as medicine, edible/food, fodder, fuel, timber, agricultural tools, etc. 
Among these, wild edible plants form an important source as a supplement/substitute 
food in times of scarcity for native communities. Because land holdings are small and 
subsistence agriculture prevails, the natives gather many wild plants for food. This paper 
presents an inventory ofwild edible plants of Indian Himalaya used by local communities. 
Over 675 wild plant species, representing 384 genera and 149 families, are used as food/ 
edible and their various parts are either consumed raw, roasted, boiled, fried, cooked or 
in the form of oil, spice, seasoning material, jams, pickles, etc. The species were analysed 
for diversity in different phytogeographical provinces, altitudinal distribution, endemism, 
origin and potentials. West Himalaya shows the highest diversity (50.96%) of edible 
plants and East Himalaya the maximum number of endemics (18 taxa) and wild relatives 
of economic plants (39 taxa) . Mass scale propagation, dissemination of information 
packages to local inhabitants to ensure that wild edibles remain as a resource for income 
generation, and strategies for conservation and management are recommended. 
INTRODUCTION 
Indian Himalaya, stretching from Jammu and 
Kashmir in the northwest to Arunachal Pradesh 
in the east, includes parts of Trans, Northwest, 
West, Central and East Himalaya (Rodger and 
Panwar, 1988). It lies between 27"50'-37"6' N and 
72'30'-97'25' 
E, covering approximately an area 
of 419 873 km2 with 2500 km length and 240 km 
width. The entire region is endowed with a wide 
range of physiography, climate, soil and biological 
wealth. It has a large altitudinal range (300- 
8000 m), with a rich diversity of habitats providing 
varied macroclimates and ecological niches not 
only for plants but also for humans. The vegetation 
along an altitudinal gradient includes sub-tropical, 
temperate, sub-alpine and alpine types. 
Indian Himalaya supports about 8000 species 
of flowering plants (47.06% of the total flowering 
plants of India) of which 30% are endemic to the 
region. The richness of the flora is due to the 
occurrence of species of other biogeographic 
regions like Irano-Turanian, Mediterranean, Inde 
Chinese, Indian, Malesian, Eastern Asiatic,

Circumboreal, Australian, Amazonian, Brazilian, 
Andean, North American and others (Chatterjee, 
1939). 
The human population of the Indian Himalaya 
is 2 018 000 which is 2.37% of the total population 
of India (Premi, 1991). The majority of them live 
in the villages and belong to diverse cultures and 
communities. Among the tribes Gaddi (Trans/ 
Northwest Himalaya), Bhotias, Rajees, Tharus, 
Buxas, Jaunsarees (West Himalaya), Bhutias, 
Lepchas (Central Himalaya) and Chakma, Nagas: 
subtribes - Singpho, Tangsa, Hillmiri, Adis, Nishi, 
Apatani, Monpas, Mijis, Akas, Knowas, Bongnis, 
Sulungs, Mishmis, Noctes, Wanchoes etc. (East 
Himalaya) are well known. The rich diversity of 
the useful plants of Indian Himalaya has been 
used by different communities as food/edible, 
medicine, fodder, fuel, timber, agricultural tools, 
religious and other purposes for a long time. 
Among these uses, wild edibles form an 
important source as a supplement or substitute 
food in time of scarcity for hill communities. The 
land holdings in the region are small and cannot 
afford optimum agricultural inputs. Therefore, 
they rely on a number of unconventional food 
plants 
such 
as 
Vzgna 
vexillata, 
(L.) 
R.Rich. (Sophlong), Chenopodium (Bathuwa), 
buckwheat (Phapar), amaranth (Chaulai), 
mushrooms (Guchhi), etc. Different parts ofwild 
plants such as roots, tubers, rhizomes, stems, 
leaves, inflorescence/flowers, fruits/seeds/ 
embryo, thallus, fruiting body or fronds are 
consumed either raw, roasted, fried, cooked, 
boiled or in the form of oil, spice, seasoning 
material, jams, pickles, etc. Currently their use is 
limited to certain communities/areas in spite of 
their potential in local, national and international 
markets. There is a great scope for enhancing the 
acceptability of wild edibles as an income- 
generating resource for the hill communities and 
the potential plant resources for human 
consumption. These attributes have necessitated 
the identification of such species to develop 
effective strategies for their wider consumption. 
In the Himalayan context, information on edible 
plants is scant and mainly restricted to 
enumerations (Arora, 1991; Atal et al., 1980; Gaur, 
1977; Hajra and Chakravorty, 1981; Jain and Sinha, 
1987; Kaul et al., 1982, 1985; Badhwar and 
Fernandes, 1964; Negi and Pant, 1992; Negi et al., 
1990; Gaur and Semwal, 1983; Negi and Gaur, 
1991; Pangtey, 1980; Singh and Arora, 1978; Brij 
La1 et al., 1994; Singh, 1994; Bhargava, 1959; 
Pangtey et aL, 1982; Raju and Krishna, 1990; 
Samant and Dhar, 1994). 
Mention of wild edibles has also been made in 
the floras and ethnobotanical studies of some 
workers (Atkinson, 1982; Anonymous, 1978-1988; 
Kirtikar and Basu, 1984; Kanjilal and Das, 1934- 
40; Pal, 1984; Grierson and Long, 1983, 1984, 
1987, 1991; Hajra and Rao, 1990; Kapur and 
Sarin, 1990; Singh and Kachroo, 1987; Saklani 
and Jain, 1987; Rao and Jamir, 1990; Rawat and 
Pangtey, 1989; Pangtey et aL, 1989; Kapahi, 1990). 
However, comprehensive explorations of the wild 
edible plants of West Himalaya, compilation of 
the wild edible plants of Indian Himalaya and the 
possibilities of exploring the economic potential, 
and accordingly developing appropriate 
conservation strategies, have not been undertaken 
so far. The present study is an initial step in this 
direction. 
METHODS 
Extensive survey of the literature was carried out 
to compile the wild edible plants of Indian 
Himalaya. Information on plant parts used, 
habitats, life forms, potential values and other 
uses was also collected from the secondary 
resources. For West Himalaya, survey/exploration 
of the area was carried out along an altitudinal 
gradient throughout the study area. The 
information collected includes identification of 
sites, habitats, plants, distribution range. 
Concurrently, through interaction with the local 
communities of the area, information on local 
names, plant parts used and mode of utilization 
were collected. Identification of West Himalayan 
edibles was made with the help of available 
literature (Osmaston, 1927; Babu, 1977; Naithani, 
1984) and the Herbarium at the Botany 
Department, Kumaun University, Nainital and 
Botanical Survey of India, Northern Circle, 
Dehradun. Information on the trade values of 
some plants was gathered from secondary sources 
(Samant et aL, 1996), local markets, and from the 
officials of the District Drug Cooperative Limited, 
Almora. The multipurpose nature of wild edibles 
was identified on the basis of information collected 
from primary and secondary sources, and

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
Diversity 
Of the 800 edible taxa reported from India (Singh 
and Arora, 1978), 300 occur in Northeast parts of 
India (Watt, 1889-99; Kanjilal et al., 1934-40). 
The present study records 675 wild edible plant 
species from Indian Himalaya, belonging to 384 
genera and 149 families. The family Rosaceae 
(45) showed the highest number of edible species, 
followed by Polygonaceae (30), Moraceae (26), 
Asteraceae (20), Fabaceae (20) , Euphorbiaceae 
(15), Anacardiaceae (1 3), Rubiaceae (1 3), 
Apiaceae (1 3), Urticaceae (1 4), Lamiaceae (12), 
Alliaceae (12), Rutaceae (12), Poaceae (13), 
Berberidaceae (1 1) , Caprifoliaceae (10) and 
Vitaceae (10). Among the genera, Rubus (20) 
showed the richness of the wild edible species 
followed by Polygonurn (18), Ficus (15), Allium 
(12), Dioscorea (9), Berbm's ( B ) ,  Pmnus (7), 
Viburnum (7), Rzbes (6), Piper (6), Grewia ( 5 ) ,  Rhus 
(5) and Chenopodium (5). The diversity of the 
taxonomic groups, families, genera, species, life 
forms and parts used is illustrated in Tables 1 
and 2. 
The distribution pattern of the wild edible 
plants of the Indian Himalaya along an altitudinal 
gradient is given in Table 3. The 1001-2OOOm 
zone exhibits the maximum diversity of wild

edibles. The mild climatic conditions and richness 
of biological resources in this zone supports the 
maximum number of habitations and diversity of 
native communities. Hence, the diversity of 
knowledge of wild plants as food is also the 
maximum in this zone. The notable edibles of 
this zone are Rhuspyjthii Hk.f., Alocasia macrmhiza 
(L.) G. Don, Penanga gracilis Bl., Caralluma

Cantharellus cibarius Fr. Above and below this 
zone, the richness of the wild edibles decreases 
gradually. The lowest number of wild edibles (i.e. 
30) occurs in the 4001-5000 m zone. Because of 
the harsh climatic conditions, this zone supports 
very specialized taxa. In addition, this zone lacks 
permanent settlements, and, consequently, 
knowledge about the potential use of many taxa 
as a supplement food is absent. This zone is 
inhabited by seasonal migrants and they use wild 
plant resources in different ways. The popular 
wild edibles of this zone are Allium jacquemontii

Laxm., Rheum speciforme Royle and Triglochin 
maritima L. 
The overlapping of the wild edibles within 
different elevational zones is noted in the present 
study. Among the wild edibles, some of the species 
show a wide range of altitudinal distribution. 
Distinguished among them are Cardamine

The numbers of wild edibles known from 
different biogeographical provinces of Indian 
Himalaya are shown in Table 4. The richest 
diversity (50.96%) of wild edibles is exhibited in 
West Himalaya (i.e. Kumaun, Garhwal). This may 
be due to the occurrence of Central/East 
Himalayan elements as well as Trans/Northwest 
Himalayan elements, forming an ecotone. 
Moreover, West Himalaya has been well explored

Wild edible plants of Indian Himalaya 
Samant and DhaT 
in comparison to other biogeographic provinces 
of Indian Himalaya. Trans/Northwest Himalaya 
with a wide geographical area (277 909 km2) 
among all the provinces exhibits lowest percentage 
(25.04%) of wild edibles (Table 4). This may be 
either due to the poor exploration of edible taxa 
from these provinces or poor knowledge of wild 
plants as food/edibles. 
The origins of wild edibles in different 
biogeographical provinces is shown in Table 5. 
Most of the taxa are Himalayan in origin. Hence, 
the chances of endemism in the wild edibles of 
Himalayan region are maximum. 
Endemism 
In spite of the influence of the flora of adjoining 
countries/region, the flora of Indian Himalaya 
includes about 46.20% (3165) endemics out of a 
total of 6850 endemics in India (Chatterjee, 1939). 
In the context of wild edibles of Indian Himalaya, 
the taxa restricted to these biogeographical 
provinces were considered as endemics and those 
extending their distribution to adjacent 
countries/states like Nepal, Bhutan, Tibet, 
Pakistan, Afghanistan, Assam and Meghalaya were 
considered as near endemics. 
Of the 675 wild edible species, 39 are restricted 
to Indian Himalayan provinces, hence classified 
as endemics. On the other hand, 93 species 
showed extension of their range to adjacent 
countries/states and are considered as near 
endemics. In a broader sense (sensu Eato), the 
near endemics represent endemics of the whole 
region. East Himalaya showed the highest number 
of endemics (18 taxa). The distribution of 
endemics in different phytogeographical 
provinces is presented in Table 6.

Wild edible plants of Indian Himalaya 
Samant and Dhar 
The potential 
Nutritional 
Wild edible plants are important and cheap 
sources of protein, carbohydrates, fats, vitamins 
and minerals; moreover, their dietary contribution 
is increased because they are available during 
most seasons, including the periods in the year 
when the conventional staples and vegetables are 
scarce. The flushes of most of the species used as 
vegetables appear in the dry season when 
cultivated vegetables are scarce. Notable among 
these are Amaranthus paniculatus L., Heracleum 
candicans Wall. ex DC., H. pinnatum Cl., Calamus 
acanthospathus Griff., Caryota obtusa Griff., 
Asparagus curillus L., Crambe kotschyana Boiss., 
Chenopodium botlysL., Fagopyrum debotrys (D. Don) 
Hara, Edgaria darjellingensis Cl., Dlyopteris elongata 
Ktze., Embelia gambb Kurz. Similarly, fruits of 
Myrica esculenta Ham., Horsfieldia kingzi (Hk.f.) 
Warburg, Syzygzum cuminii (L.) Skeels, S. venosum 
DC., Fragaria vesca L., Prunus comzuta (Wall. ex 
Royle) Steud., Rubus spp., Berba's spp. are ripe 
when cultivated fruits are not available 
Nutritive values of some of the wild edibles are 
known and the values presented compare well 
with the values for cultivated/domesticated plants 
(Table 7). For example, The pods of Lathlyrus 
sativus L. contain 10% moisture, 28.20% protein, 
0.60% fat and 58.20% carbohydrate and is one of 
the preferred vegetables of the Himalayan 
communities. Seeds of Castanea sativa Mill. 
(29.30% moisture, 10.90% Protein, 1.84% fat and 
32.64% carbohydrate) are used as a substitute for 
cashew nuts in West Himalaya. The foliage and 
seeds of Amaranthus paniculatus L. are edible and 
contain minerals (Fe, Ca) and carbohydrates 
(55.87%). They have a considerably higher grain 
yield. Grains assume more nutritional significance 
as bread, pastry, biscuits, flacks, crackers, ice 
creams and elaborating lysine-rich body foods 
(Anonymous, 1970-1988). 
The wild edible mushrooms (Morchella escuhta 
(L.) Pers., M. comica Pers., Pleurotus ostreatus 
(Jacq.) Fr., Boletus edulis Bull. ex Fr., Cantharellus 
cibaricus Fr., Hydnum coralloides Scop. and 
Lycoperdon gemmatum Bats.) are used as a delicacy 
for domestic consumption as well as in tourist 
hotels. They are rich in proteins, especially in 
lysine and leucine, which are lacking in most of 
the staple cereal foods (Anonymous, 1970-1988). 
Medicinal 
In many instances it is very difficult to make a 
distinction between food and medicinal values. 
Many wild edible species are also used in 
traditional medicine. Of the 675 species recorded, 
1'71 are used in traditional medicine. For example, 
the leaves and roots of Taraxacum officinalewebb., 
the roots of Costus speciosa (Koenig) Sm., the 
tubers and seeds of Arisaema tortuosum L., the 
leaves of Dipsacus i n a i s  Wall. and the tubers of 
Dicentra thalictroides Hk.f. are reputed as poison 
antidotes. 
The roots of Geranium wallichianum Don ex 
Sweet are given for colds, dysentery, and ear 
troubles; the roots of Flemingza vestita Benth. ex 
Baker are given for hysteria; the rhizome of 
Podophyllum hexandrum Royle is used in tumour, 
skin diseases and as a purgative; the fruits of 
Hippophue salicqolia D. Don are used to treat 
coughs, colds, influenza and lung complaints; 
the roots of Angelica glauca Edgew. and 
Pleurospermum angelicoides (DC.) C1. are used as a 
treatment for food poisoning and dysentery. In 
addition, most of the species contain coumarins, 
alkaloids, flavonoids, steroids and triterpenes and 
are used in the treatment of a variety of diseases/ 
ailments (Pathak et al., 1986). 
Oil seeds 
In order to meet the acute shortage of oils and 
fats in the countxy, the potential of oil seeds of 
forest origin can be augmented. The Indian 
Himalaya is rich in oil seed-bearing plants. It is 
therefore imperative to document oil seed-bearing 
edibles of the Himalaya. 
In the present study, 32 species of wild edibles 
bear oil seeds and the percentage of yield for 
each species is indicated in Table 8. Seeds of 
Diploknema butyracea (Roxb.) Lam. provide a soft 
tallow which is used as a cooking medium and the 
oil produced from Prinsepia utzlis Royle is used as 
a cooking medium as well as for burning. Studies 
on such species merit attention. 
Multipurpose utility 
Among the wild edibles of the Indian Himalaya, 
some species are used by the local communities

for more than one purposes (Table 9). For 
example, the leaves and petioles of Moringa 
oleijka Lamk. are used medicinally, the seeds 
yield ben oil, used by watchmakers, and the 
young roots make a good substitute for the true 
horseradish. Fruits of Litsea cubeca (Lour.) 
Pearson are used medicinally and the leaves for 
rearing silkworm (Grierson & Long, 1984). 
Castanopsis indica (Roxb.) A.DC., C. tribuloides 
A.DC., Ouercus leucotm'chophora A. Camus and 4. 
jloribunda Rehder provide excellent fodder, fuel 
and timber. Ougeinia oojeinenszs (Roxb.) Hochr. 
adds to soil fertility and is used by the inhabitants 
for their day to day requirements of fodder, fuel, 
timber, agricultural tools and miscellaneous 
items. Diploknema butyracea (Roxb.) Lam. is liked 
by the local inhabitants for its fruits, vegetable 
oil, fodder, fuel and fragrant flowers that attract 
honey bees. 
Commerce/trade 
Wild edible species are not only consumed for 
food by the hill communities but are also a source 
of income generation. In the West Himalaya, 
Kumaon Mandal Vikas Nigam, Garhwal Mandal 
Vikas Nigam and the District Drug Cooperative 
Limited are the active exploiters and traders. The

in the East Himalaya (Central/East) and 132 in 
the contiguous belt of Northeast Region (Arora 
and Nayar, 1984). The present study reveals the 
occurrence of 28 wild edible species in Trans/ 
Northwest/West Himalaya and 39 in Central/ 
East Himalaya (Table 11). Species recorded merit 
attention of horticulturists because they could 
possibly be utilised as marketable fruits. 
Edible plants of the wild habitats contribute 
economic value by virtue of their use in 
indigenous and immigrant cultures, and by their 
taxonomic proximity to cultivated species. Most 
of the wild edible species provide a good root 
stock for the commercial cultivars of the fruit 
crops because of their wider adaptability, 
vigorous growth, and resistance to major diseases 
and pests. Hence, the native fruit species can be 
utilized as a good breeding material for the 
improvement of horticultural crops (Arora and 
Nayar, 1984; Paroda and Arora, 1986). It must 
be added that while each of the wild edible 
species exhibits desirable qualities, they would 
nonetheless require significant improvement 
through breeding and selection. To assess their 
existing and potential economic value, 
ethnobotanical observations, quantitative data 
on the diversity and abundance of the species 
need to be intensified.

Indian Himalaya represents a rich diversity 
of the wild edible species which are capable 
of supplementing the food requirements 
of hill communities. However, there is 
scope to enhance the diversity of these 
species through survey/exploration of 
unexplored areas and interviews/ 
interactions with the local communities of 
the Indian Himalayan regions. 
Adequate information on population 
biology (i.e. habit, habitat, life form, 
distribution range, population size, 
phenology, reproduction, pollination, seed 
biology, seedling ecology and several other 
aspects) for potential species is essential. 
Mass scale propagation of wild edibles in 
the nurseries, arboreta and botanical 
gardens through asexual and sexual 
methods need to be popularised among 
the hill communities for their conservation 
and management. 
Proper evaluation of the potentials and 
dissemination of this information package 
to hill communities need to be prioritized. 
Wild edible species may prove a good root 
stock for the commercial cultivars of the 
fruit crops due to their wider adaptability 
to abrupt climatic variations, vigour, 
growth and resistance to insects and pests. 
Hence, these may be utilized as good 
breeding material for the improvement of 
horticultural crops as well as restoration 
and reclamation of degraded land and 
revised cropping systems. 
To maintain the ecosystem equilibrium, 
awareness of the sustainable utilization of 
these species needs to be created among 
the hill communities.
