Garhwal Himalaya represents one of the richest zones of vegetational wealth in India. Pterid- 
ophytic flora is also interesting in its diversity and distribution, however, little is worked out on 
the economic aspects of these plants. Therefore, present communication pertains to the folk 
utilization of ferns and fern-allies by the inhabitants of Deoprayag Tehsil in Garhwal Himalaya. 
The studies are based on frequent field trips to various remote localities and collecting the 
information from the local inhabitants. The perusal of literature indicated several little known 
plants of folk utilization, and a large number of these could prove an important source of wider 
economic utility after phytochemical analysis. 
Key Words: Pteridophytes; edible ferns; medicinal ferns; fodder; manure; fire resistance; soil 
binders. 
Angiosperms of the Deoprayag and surround- 
ing area of Garhwal Himalaya (78*--79 ~ longi- 
tude, 29*--30* latitude) ofUttar Pradesh attracted 
wide attention for taxonomic and economic bot- 
any points. Pteridophyte plants in contrast have 
received only limited attention (Gaur 1977; Gaur 
and Semwal 1983; Gaur, Semwal, and Tiwari 
1984; Gaur and Tiwari 1988). 
Studies on fern and fern-allies in this region 
have been carried out by several investigators 
(Beddome 1883; Clarke 1880; Hope 1899; Du- 
thie 1906) and others. More recently Bir et al. 
(1983), Dhir and Sood (1981), Goel and Bhat- 
tacharyya (1981), and Rau (1961) have contrib- 
uted toward the understanding of the fern flora 
of different quarters of Garhwal Himalaya. In 
general there is little information on the ethno- 
botanical and economic aspects of pteridophytic 
plants from India, including the presently inves- 
tigated area (Anonymous 1948-1976; Anony- 
mous 1986; Jain 1991) and only a few scattered 
economic reports are available (Bir et al. 1983; 
Dagar and Dagar 1987; Dixit 1974; Dixit, Dad, 
and Kar 1978; Islam 1983; Gaur and Semwal 
1983; Kapur and Sarin 1977; Padala 1988; Purl 
t Received 3 February 1992; accepted 2 September 
1993. 
and Puri 1970; Sharma and Vyas 1985; Singh 
1973). Because fern and fern-allies are relatively 
little known for their economic utilization, sev- 
eral workers have emphasized this aspect of the 
group (Aderkas 1984; Bir et al. 1983; Copeland 
1942; Duke 1972; Harborne 1966; May 1978; 
Padala 1988; Panvisavas, Worthen, and Bohw 
1968; Strain and Cooper 1973; Tryon and Tryon 
1982). 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
Frequent field surveys were made during July 
1986 to June 1989, covering various remote lo- 
calities in different seasons. All the specimens 
selected in the folk utilization were collected in 
the field with the assistance of informants. From 
the voucher plant specimens, the information on 
folk utilization were gathered either from older 
inhabitants, local medical practioners (Vedyas), 
women folk or others. Usually the information 
was verified by repeated queries from the local 
inhabitants of different professions, ages and vil- 
lages. The collected specimens are followed with 
the usual methods of herbarium preparations 
proposed by Jain and Rao (1977). The specimens 
are identified from the voucher specimens of Bo- 
tanical Survey of India, Northern Circle, Deh- 
radun (BSD) and housed in the Herbarium Garh- 
wal University (GUH).

DISCUSSION 
Our survey has revealed that ferns and fern- 
allies are closely related to the lives of village 
people, especially as food, fodder, manure and 
medicines. Older inhabitants attest to their im- 
portance in maintaining the deteriorating envi- 
ronment. 
Only a limited number of fern and fern-allies 
are used for food (Aderkas 1984; Copeland 1942; 
Komarov 1934; May 1978; Medsger 1939). Most 
of the species are used as pot vegetables often 
fried with animal fat or vegetable oil, rarely as 
flavoring agents or pickled. Investigations in this 
part of the Himalaya have disclosed some well 
known edibles such as Diplazium polypodioides, 
Dryopteris odontoloma, Nephrolepis cordifolia. 
Young fronds of Ampelopteris prolifera, Dipla- 
zium esculentum, Drynaria quercifolia, Dryop- 
teris wallichiana and Pteridium aquilinum eaten 
here are not much used in other parts of India 
(Anonymous 1986). To make palatable prepa- 
rations, the edible parts are boiled in water and 
squeezed to remove toughness and toxic sub- 
stances, as in Botrychium lanuginosum, Dipla- 
zium esculentum and Nephrolepis cordifolia. 
Leaves of Dryopteris odontoloma and D. wallich- 
iana are dried in the sun and stored for use as 
vegetable during periods of scarcity, although the 
flavor is said to deteriorate in storage (Aderkas 
1984). 
Information on ferns and fern-allies in the 
treatment of various ailments has been gathered 
from the traditional practioners. There is uni- 
formity in the remedial properties of different 
plants, however, the dosage pattern is variable 
subject to the experience and knowledge of med- 
ical practitioners and the patient. The local prep- 
arations are in crude form, such as fresh plant 
paste for external applications; extract or juice is 
applied without standard proportions of plant 
material to water. For internal consumption de- 
coctions or infusions of various concentrations 
are used. In several preparations for internal con- 
sumption, starchy water of cooked rice is added 
with plant parts. 
Some of the pteridophytes which are potential 
drug sources, have been investigated phytochem- 
ically, e.g., species of Adiantum, Botrychium, Eq- 
uisetum, L ycopodium, Ophioglossum, Osmunda, 
Pteridium and other genera (Gurung 1979; Har- 
borne 1966; Newberne 1976; Panvisavas, Wor- 
then, and Bohw 1968; Strain and Cooper 1973).

Arthromeris wallichiana, Coniogramme cauda-

erubescens, Huperzia subulifolia, Lepisorus 
clathratus, Polypodium subamoenum, Polysti- 
chum nepalense and Woodwardia unigemmata 
are medicinally little known and could prove 
phytochemically active. 
Preparation of green manure from fern and 
fern-allies is a common practice in this region, 
but has been little investigated. For this purpose, 
fresh plant parts are laid as bedding for live- 
stock, this material is partially deteriorated by 
excretory products, frequently replaced, and ul- 
timately stored in an open heap for final decom- 
position to manure. Local populace use several 
pteridophytes as palatable fodder for their live- 
stock. Arthromeris wallichiana, Athyrium schim- 
perL Diplazium polypodioides, Dryopteris wal- 
lichiana, Pteridium aquilinum are much used for 
this purpose. 
Ampelopteris prolifera, Diplazium esculentum, 
Drynaria quercifolia and Woodwardia unigem- 
mata have the capacity to spread vigorously in 
denuded areas, acting as soil binders. 
Asplenium planicaule, Botrychium lanuginos-

zium polypodioides, Dryopteris wallichiana, D. 
odontoloma, Huperzia subulifolia, Nephrolepis 
cordifolia and Pteridium aquilinum from wild 
habitats are extensively used by local people for 
various purposes, resulting in the depletion of 
their population, suggesting the application of in 
situ conservation methods.

Boox REVIEW 
The Gourd Book. Chafes B. Heiser, Jr. University of 
Oklahoma Press, Norman, OK 73070. 1993. viii 
+ 248 pp. $16.95. (paperback edition of 1979 book). 
ISBN 0-8061-2572-1. 
When we learned of the recently published paper- 
back version of Heiser's The Gourd Book, we greatly 
appreciated receiving the book for review. Given the 
age of the original hard-cover volume, we expected an 
updated and expanded version of the original. How- 
ever, aside from a 3-page "Preface to the Paperback 
Edition" the paperback is merely a reprint of the 1979 
publication. This is disappointing for, as Heiser points 
out in the Preface, much has been learned in the past 
15 years. Nomenclature has changed, old theories have 
been revised, and new ethnobotanical and medicinal 
studies have been performed. 
Our initial disappointment aside, The Gourd Book 
remains the most recent comprehensive volume on the 
bottle gourd, Lagenaria siceraria (Cucurbitaceae). In 
very readable and entertaining text, Heiser discusses 
an interesting assortment of myths, uses, and dispersal 
theories associated with this gourd species. The many 
photographs and drawings, a few of which are in color, 
themselves tell fascinating stories. 
Although written to a lay audience, many gourd en- 
thusiasts might be disappointed by the lack of detailed 
information in Heiser's book on gourd culture and craft. 
But given that a wealth of information on these topics 
is available through publications of the American Gourd 
Society, The Gourd Book strives instead to give its 
readers a historical, ethnobotanical, and scientific per- 
spective on one of our oldest cultivated plants. 
Although most of the text is devoted to the bottle 
gourd, there are chapters written about the other two 
groups of commonly recognized gourds--species of 
Cucurbita and the tree gourd, Crescentia cujete (Big- 
noniaceae). Also included are chapters on various other 
members of the Cucurbitaceae (e.g., Benincasa, Cu- 
cumis, Luffa, Momordica, Trichosanthes). Although 
most are not gourd-like in the sense of having a tough 
rind, Heiser follows L. H. Bailey's lead in his Garden 
of Gourds, 1937, of discussing cucurbits of ornamental 
interest. 
Anyone teaching a course having a general interest 
in plants, ethnobotany, or origins of domestication 
should have this publication in their library. For many 
of us, the original 1979 edition was no longer available. 
Now we have the opportunity to obtain once again the 
"classic" book on gourds.
