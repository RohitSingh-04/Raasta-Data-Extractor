ABSTRACT
A synthesis of ethnopharmacological knowledge and
western biological science has been attempted in this
paper. Thirty-four species of plants used by local
women in hamlets of Banjar taluka, Kulu district,
Himachal Pradesh have been recorded. The knowl-
edge of medicinal plants that local women have is
important as they have a lifetime experience in using
them through caring for themselves, their families and
others around them. For the plants recorded, informa-
tion from scientiﬁc literature has been included in
order to explain or justify the traditional medical use.
INTRODUCTION
The Himalayas comprise of a large mountain system
and stretches over 3000 km in length from its junction
with the Karakoram ranges in the west to the Arakan
mountains on the Assam-Bhutan border in the east. The
vegetation of Himalayas is distinct, i.e., tropical, tem-
perate and alpine. This region is rich in ﬂoral diversity;
a total of about 9000 plant species occur here. The rich-
ness is due primarily to a great variation in climate and
habitat. Different types of ﬂora exist within quite a
short distance (Polunin & Stainten, 1984). Among the
major geographical divisions of the Himalaya,
Himachal Pradesh falls into the Kumaon-Garwhal or
Western Himalayan region.
The total population of Himachal Pradesh is
5,170,877. Out of these, 1,054,000 belong to scheduled
castes, and 197,000 belong to scheduled tribes (Census,
1981). The State covers an area of 55,673 km2 and is
divided in to 12 districts of which Kulu district is one.
This district has an area of 5503 km2 with 3 talukas,
Ani, Banjar and Nermand, and is situated at a height of
about 1500 metres above sea level. The climate of the
region ranges from warm to temperate type. The main
seasons are summer (March to August), monsoon
(August to October) and winter (November to Febru-
ary), the latter is often accompanied by snowfall in the
months of December and January.
The ﬁeld work was undertaken in the hamlets of
Banjar taluka of Kulu district. The local people are pre-
dominantly Hindus but some aspects of Buddhism is
also incorporated into their traditions. The dominant
castes in the area studied are Brahmins, Rajputs, and
Scheduled Castes. The language they speak is a dialect
of Hindi and is called Kulluvi Pahari. This language
exists only in spoken form.
The people are poor and the area is underdeveloped.
Basic amenities such as clean water are not available
and the hygienic conditions are therefore appalling.
Their staple food is rice and rajma. Wheat is also con-
sumed, but this habit is comparatively new. Some veg-
etables are also grown. Agriculture and grazing are
practised only at subsistance level. Due to the avail-
ability of medicinal herbs in the region there is a thriv-
ing trade in herbs. The local people are involved in herb
collection during the summer months and this is the
only means of cash income for many of them. Barring
a few locals, the traders in these herbs are mostly mid-
dlemen who do not belong to the area.
A survey of medicinal plants of western Himalayas
was undertaken by Gupta (1962). Another survey of

medicinal and aromatic plants used for local purposes
and those exploited in varying quantities for export out-
side the district was carried out in Chamba district by
Gupta (1964, 1971). Uniyal and Chauhan (1973) have
documented the traditional medicinal plants from Kan-
gra valley in Dharmsala forest circle. Ethnobotanical
surveys of Himachal Pradesh were carried out by
Gupta (1981) and of Sirmur district by Chauhan and
Chauhan (1986). An account of edible plants used by
Gujjars and Gaddis from Mandi district was given by
Singh (1966). However, Kulu district has not been sur-
veyed from the ethnobotanical point of view, so far.
Because of the diverse range of species there is a great
deal of knowledge to be recorded. An inventory of
plants used as medicine by the local women in Banjar
taluka of Kulu district was undertaken. For these plants,
literature from modern scientiﬁc investigations have
been included wherever possible in order to explain or
substantiate the traditional use.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The interviews were conducted in Banjar taluka and
surrounding hamlets. Banjar is about 28 km from the
Kulu urban area. The hamlets from where the informa-
tion was obtained are Devri Gaon, Ghat Ghar, Ropa,
Shoja and also in Banjar. These lie within a span of 2–6
km from Banjar except for Shoja which is about 12 km
away. The hamlets Shoja and Ropa are situated at an
altitude of 2683 and 1524, respectively, and Banjar at
1680 m. Devri Gaon and Ghat Ghar are very close to
Banjar, i.e., about the same level as that of Banjar.
The focus of the study was the to register the
ethnopharmacological 
knowledge 
possessed 
by
women, especially the elderly and the middleaged.
Women were chosen in this study as they have a long
experience in caring for themselves, their families and
those around them. During the initial survey one
woman who had been introduced by the villagers
became the key person. This led the way to the intro-
duction to other knowledgeable informants. The
women from each area of the study accompanied one
of the present authors to the ﬁeld, showed her the
plants, and they provided the local names and informa-
tion as to which health condition the plants were used,
and the method of preparation and administration of
remedies.
The plant species described by the women were col-
lected and herbarium sheets prepared. The Latin names
of plants were identiﬁed with the help of scientists, A.
Sakhlani and Bhaskar Dutt, from the National Botani-
cal Research Institute, Lucknow, India. One set of the
voucher specimens is kept at the Herbarium of the
Botanical Garden and Museum of the University of
Oslo at Tøyen, Norway, and three other sets at the fol-
lowing institutions/organisation in India: herbarium of
the Tropical Botanic Gardens and Research Institute at
Thiruvananthapuram, National Botanical Research
Institute’s herbarium, in Lucknow, and the office of the
Research Foundation for Science, Technology and Nat-
ural Resources Policy, a non-governmental organisa-
tion in New Delhi.
The plant species have been arranged in alphabeti-
cal order, with the following information for each of
them: Latin name, family, herbarium number, local
name and plant part used in traditional treatment.
Literature Review
A survey of the literature was conducted to verify or
substantiate the claimed medical use(s) of the plant.
Data on chemistry and biology are described where
these are available or relevant.
For the reference Harborne and Baxter (1993), the
page numbers are given with the reference.
RESULTS
1. Acorus calamus L.; Araceae; Bhanumathi 9–96;
Bach; rhizome.
The rhizomes are made into a paste with water and
applied to the scalp in order to get rid of lice.
Insecticidal and antibacterial activities were
observed with extracts prepared from the rhizome
(Chopra et al.,1957; Mukerjea & Govind, 1960; Vashi
& Patel, 1987). In addition, the compound 1-(p-hydrox-
yphenyl)–1-(O-acetyl)prop-2-ene isolated from the rhi-
zome was found to be highly active against
Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria (Chowd-
hury et al., 1993). Some of the volatile compounds
identiﬁed by Mazza (1985) were terpineol, carvone,
carvacrol and curcumin. The ﬁrst three compounds
have been shown to possess antiseptic properties and
the fourth anti-inﬂammatory property (Harborne &
Baxter, 1993: pp. 478, 558, 567). The above descrip-
tion may explain the traditional use of the plant against
lice as infection caused by lice may lead to itching,
eczematous dermatitis and if neglected for a long time,
scratching may result in marked inﬂammation. Second-
ary infection by bacteria may also occur, with forma-
tion of pustules, crusts and suppuration.

Several sesquiterpenes (Iguchi et al., 1969; Yama-
mura et al., 1971; Niwa et al., 1975; Nawamaki &
Kuroyanagi, 1996) and various fatty acids and sugars
(Asif et al., 1984) have also been found in the plant.
2. Adiantum phillipense L., Adiantaceae; Bhanumathi
32–96; Matada; root.
The roots of the fern are pounded and eaten against
painful urination.
No scientiﬁc investigation reports exist for this
plant.
3. Ajuga bracteosa Benth.; Lamiaceae; Bhanumathi
10–96; Nilkant; aerial parts.
Dried aerial parts and about 7–10 white pepper
corns are made into a powder, mixed with mustard oil
and applied on areas affected by scabies.
Several neo-cleodane diterpenoids were identiﬁed
from the leaves and have been shown to possess insec-
ticidal and insect antifeedant activities (Kubo, 1980;
Kubo et al., 1976, 1981, 1982, 1983). It is not clear,
however if the above mentioned activities can be effec-
tivite against scabies arachnid, the itch mite, Sarcoptes
scabii var. hominis. Further investigations are necessary.
Pinenes and piperine of white pepper, Piper nigrum
L. (Samuelson, 1992) are used as an insecticide (Har-
borne & Baxter, 1993: pp. 252, 565). An ethanolic
extract showed antimicrobial activity (Perez & Anesini,
1994). One of the species from which mustard oil is
extracted is Brassica juncea. The oil from the seeds of
this plant has been shown to be efficacious against some
Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria (Prasad et
al., 1993). The antimicrobial property of pepper and
mustard oil may help against secondary infections
which may arise due to oozing or scratching thereby
only partly explaining the traditional use of the plant.
4. Anagallis arvense L., Primulaceae; Bhanumathi
15–96; Jokhu Ghas; aerial parts.
The aerial parts of the plant are crushed with water
and used as nose drops against some kind of a parasite
or (micro)organism which causes bleeding from the
nose and headache. This is claimed to occur when peo-
ple drink water from the streams.
Compounds like kaempferol, quercetin and rutin
have been isolated from the ﬂowers (Rastogi & Narula,
1980). These compounds possess antibacterial and
anti-inﬂammatory activities (Harborne & Baxter, 1993,
pp. 402, 408, 474). The entry of a parasite or a microor-
ganism may cause injury to the soft mucuous mem-
brane of the nose and can result in bleeding. This may
further lead to infections followed by inﬂammation and
pain. The anti-inﬂammatory activity may help to
reduce inﬂammation of the mucous membrane. The
bleeding may be reduced and decongest the nostril.
This can also reduce the headache. Further anti-inﬂam-
matory drugs are often used as analgesics because of
their ability to inhibit prostaglandin synthesis
(Katzung, 1984). All the above mentioned properties
together with the antibacterial property may help
against infections thereby probably explaining the tra-
ditional use.
5. Berberis lycium Royle-I; Berberidaceae; Bhanu-
mathi 8–96; Makshohallo; roots, ﬂowers.
The roots are boiled in water, ﬁltered and the extract
used to wash the eye several times against reddishness
caused by heat.
Dried ﬂowers are roasted with ghee (cured butter)
over ﬁre and given to children between 3 and 4 years of
age, twice a day, morning and evening, for 5–6 days
against diarrhoea.
Several alkaloids have been isolated from the roots.
Tannins have also been found (Ikram et al., 1966;
Miana et al., 1969; Sehdev et al., 1971; Ali & Khan,
1978; Chandra & Purohit, 1980). Berberine and berbe-
nine, two of the alkaloids that have been isolated, pos-
sess antimicrobial activity (Harborne & Baxter, 1993,
pp. 196, 197). Phenols and related compounds (tannic
acid) are widely used as antiseptics (Friedman, 1980).
The property of tannins and the antimicrobial activity
may help against the infection of the eye and this may
explain the traditional use of the plant.
The alkaloids berberine and berbamine possess
some biological activities (Tai et al., 1981; Sack &
Froehlich, 1982).
The ﬂowers have not been studied so far.
6. Bergenia stracheyi (Hook f & Thomas) Engler; Sax-
ifragraceae; Bhanumathi 26–96; Shabli; roots.
The roots are powdered and boiled with water and
taken internally early in the morning on an empty stom-
ach against dysentry where blood passed along with
stools.
Bergenin and ()-catechin-3-gallate (Bahl et al.,
1974) have been isolated from the plant. None of the
compounds identiﬁed can directly explain the tradi-
tional use although some compounds related to ()-
catechin-3-gallate possess antiviral (von Wacher &
Eilmes, 1978; Wagner et al., 1985; Tadakatsu & Yuki-
hiko, 1991) and antibacterial activities (Das, 1962;
Nishino et al., 1987; Ahn et al., 1991) which may help

against dysentry as it can be due to bacterial or viral
infection. It would therefore be worthwhile to investi-
gate the plant further for compounds with antimicrobial
properties, in order to substantiate traditional use.
7. Calamintha umbrosa Benth.; Lamiaceae; Bhanu-
mathi 27–96; Babri; aerial parts.
The aerial parts are made into a paste with water and
applied to boils. This treatment is recommended for
children as well as adults.
Chemical and biological analyses should be carried
out with this plant.
8. Campanula colorata Wall.; Campanulaceae; Bhanu-
mathi 40–96; whole plant.
The whole plant is made into a paste with water and
applied to boils.
Scientiﬁc investigations should be conducted for
this plant.
9. Dermatocarpon miniatum (L.) Mann.; Verrucari-
aceae; Bhanumathi 38–96; Dach; whole thallus.
The thalli of the lichen is rubbed on a stone with
water and jaggery and used for application against
blemishes on the skin and dry skin accumulation.
Various carotenoids were found in D. miniatum
(Czeczuga & Bubrick, 1986; Czeczuga & Alstrup,
1987). Certain carotenoids are precursors of vitamin A
which can be important for certain dermatological
effects. Further studies are necessary in order to sub-
stantiate traditional use.
10. Elaeagnus umbellata Auct. (non. Thunb.) syn. E.
parviﬂora Wall ex. Royle; Elaeagnaceae; Bhanumathi
2–96; Gai; ﬂowers.
Flowers are roasted in ghee and given to children for
3–4 days, a remedy used when children have difficulty
in urinating due to heat.
Aliphatic alcohols, aldehydes, acetates and related
substances, aromatics, terpenes, etc., have been identi-
ﬁed from the ﬂowers and their associated leaves. Of the
main compounds, 4-methyl phenol (Potter, 1995) pos-
sesses antiseptic properties and is used as a local anti-
septic (Harborne & Baxter 1993, p. 457). The
traditional use may be justiﬁed by the antiseptic prop-
erty as infections can cause difficulty in urination.
11. Galium aparine L.; Rubiaceae; Bhanumathi 3–96;
Khashosho; aerial parts.
The aerial parts are made into a paste with water and
the paste is applied 3–4 times to cuts.
From the aerial parts, several compounds were iso-
lated, of which chlorogenic acid, scopoletin, rutin
(Seabra et al., 1993; Tzakou et al., 1994) and aucubin
(Tanker & Ergun, 1983; Ergun & Sener, 1986) were
some. These compounds possess antibacterial and anti-
viral activities (Harborne and Baxter 1993, pp. 364, 410,
475, 572) which may partially explain the traditional
use of the plant as infections very often follow cuts.
Sterols and fatty acids (Tzakou et al., 1990) have
also been identiﬁed in the plant.
12. Juncus glaucus Ehrh.; Juncaceae; Bhanumathi
37–96; Moonja; leaves.
The leaves are boiled in water and the tea is given
against coughs.
Neither chemical nor biological analyses have been
conducted for this plant.
13. Malva verticillata L.; Malvaceae; Bhanumathi
12–96; Sochala; roots.
Roots, about seven black pepper corns and sugar are
made into a paste with water and taken internally
against leucorrhoea.
The roots have not been investigated so far for
chemical contents or biological activities.
An ethanolic extract of the fruits of P. nigrum
showed antibacterial activity (Perez & Anesini, 1994)
and this effect may help against the problem as bacter-
ial infection can cause leucorrhea. Although the tradi-
tional use appears to be substantiated by pepper,
chemical and biological analyses should be conducted
with the roots of M. verticillata.
Sugar is also used in the medicinal mixture. Its use
may be to soothe the pungency of pepper.
14. Oxalis corniculata L.; Oxalidaceae; Bhanumathi
20–96; Millimalori; leaves.
The leaves are claimed to be mixed with pudina
(Mentha piperita L.) or used separately, made into a
paste with water and consumed early in the morning on
an empty stomach for 2 days against stomachaches.
Tannins, lignins, etc., have been identiﬁed in the
green parts of the plant (Marks et al., 1988). Tannins
are used as antiseptics (as explained under Berberis
lycium) and this property may help ﬁght microbial
infections as stomachaches can arise as a result of such
infections. Thus, the traditional use may be veriﬁed.
Some ﬂavones have been found in the plant
(Gunasegaran, 1992). Seventeen different chemical
compounds were isolated which included a series of
esters, 2-heptenal, 2-pentylfuran and trans-phytol from

the plant (Lin et al., 1992). None of these compounds
can explain the traditional use of O. corniculata.
The leaves of pudina, Mentha piperita L., were
sometimes used along with the leaves of O. corniculata
L. The leaves of pudina contain various compounds
like ﬂavonoids, triterpenes and carotenoids in addition
to essential oil containing menthol, menthone and their
isomers (Brillo, 1989; Bruneton, 1995). Further, the
leaves also contained apigenin, caffeic acid, etc. (Gella
et al., 1966). Apigenin and caffeic acid possess antibac-
terial, antiviral, antifungal and analgesic properties
(Harborne & Baxter, 1993, pp. 391, 474). Menthol and
methone possess analgesic and antiseptic properties
and are used as a carminative and a gastric sedative
(Harborne & Baxter, 1993, p. 563).
Stomachaches can be caused by a variety of reasons,
most common being bacterial, viral or fungal infections
or indigestion. Although the traditional use cannot be
explained for the plant O. corniculata L., the com-
pounds present in M. piperata L. may help against
stomachaches. Further scientiﬁc investigations should
be conducted with O. corniculata L. in order to verify
the traditional use.
15. Persicaria capitata (Buch-Ham. ex D. Don) Gross
syn. Polygonum capitatum Buch-Ham ex D. Don;
Polygonaceae; Bhanumathi 39–96; Ludari; whole plant.
The whole plant is used to make a paste with water
and applied to boils.
Chemical and biological analyses should be under-
taken.
16. Plagiochasma apendiculatum L. et L.; Rebouli-
aceae; Bhanumathi 18–96; Matada; leaves.
The thallus of the moss are made into a paste with
water and applied on burns for both children and adults.
Scientiﬁc investigations should be conducted for the
plant.
17. Plantago lanceolata L.; Plantaginaceae; Bhanu-
mathi 6–96; Chashi; whole leaves.
The whole leaf is used against stubborn boils ﬁlled
with puss. The leaf is slightly toasted over ﬁre until
warm, placed over the boil and warm mustard oil is
poured over it. It is also optional to place the leaves
over the boil without warming. This treatment is
repeated 3–4-times until the puss is released.
Some of the several compounds that were isolated
from the leaves/aerial parts are aucubin, protocate-
chuic, gentisic, vanillic, caffeic, ferulic and chlorogenic
acids (Maksyntina, 1971; Swiatek, 1977; Handjieva et
al., 1991). These compounds possess antibacterial,
anti-inﬂammatory and analgesic properties (Harborne
& Baxter, 1993, pp. 458, 461, 465, 474, 475, 480,
572). The antibacterial effect of these compounds may
be helpful in ﬁghting the bacterial infection of the boil.
In addition, the use of mustard oil may also contribute
to the antibacterial effect (see Ajuga bracterosa). Ace-
toside and plantamajoside isolated from the leaves of P.
lanceolata showed inhibitory effects on arachidonic
acid-induced mouse ear edema (Murai et al., 1995).
The anti-inﬂammatory and analgesic effect may help in
reducing inﬂammation and pain thereby explaining the
traditional use of the plant. Polysaccharides with anti-
complementary effect have also been found in the
leaves (Majed, 1996).
18. Potentilla supina L.; Rosaceae; Bhanumathi 28–96;
Bimpad; aerial parts.
The aerial parts are made into a paste with water and
applied to small boils ﬁlled with puss.
Chemical and biological investigations should be
conducted with the aerial parts of the plant.
19. Prinsepia utilis Royle; Rosaceae; Bhanumathi
17–96; Deykhal; leaves.
The leaves are made into a paste with water and
applied to boils ﬁlled with puss.
The leaves in particular should be the target of
chemical and biological tests in order to substantiate
the traditional use.
20. Rabdosia rugosa (Wall) Hara (Plectranthus rugo-
sus Wall ex Benth.); Lamiaceae; Bhanumathi 4–96;
Chichidi; leaves.
A few leaves are crushed with some water, made
into a paste and applied on swelling of hands and legs
for 3–4 days.
Ursolic acid, oleanolic acid, etc., were present in the
whole plant (Misra et al., 1971) and have been shown to
possess anti-inﬂammatory activity (Takagi et al., 1980;
Kosuge et al., 1985; Singh et al., 1992; Liu, 1995). The
traditional use against inﬂammation may be substanti-
ated by the properties of the compounds. Yet, further
studies should be conducted with the leaves alone.
Some other triterpenoids (Razdan et al., 1982 a,b)
have also been isolated from the plant.
21. Ranunculus laelus Wall.; Rannunculaceae; Bhanu-
mathi 14–96; Miga; aerial parts.
The aerial parts are made into a paste with water and
applied to boils.

For personal use only.
Scientiﬁc investigations should be conducted with
the aerial parts of the plant in order to substantiate tra-
ditional use.
22. Rhododendron arboreum Sm.; Ericaceae; Bhanu-
mathi 7–96; Brass; ﬂowers.
Some ﬂowers are roasted in ghee and given to child-
ren early in the morning on an empty stomach. This
treatment is given to ease the evacuation of bowels and
thereby stop bleeding that arises due to the difficulty in
passing stools. It is claimed that this condition is caused
due to heat especially during summer months.
Many sugars, ﬂavones and other compounds have
been isolated from the plant (Susheela & Pruthi, 1976;
Rawat & Rawat, 1993; Kamil & Shaﬁullah, 1995). The
traditional use cannot be supported by the compounds
found in the plant.
23. Rosa brunonii Lindley; Rosaceae; Bhanumathi
34–96; Kuji; ﬂowers.
The ﬂowers are mixed with some sugar and made
into a jam. One to two spoons of the mixture is taken
once a day to reduce body heat.
Scientiﬁc investigations should be undertaken in
order to substantiate the traditional use.
24. Roylea cinerea (D. Don) Baill.; Lamiaceae; Bhanu-
mathi 19–96; Kori; aerial parts.
The aerial parts are mixed with equal parts of water
and taken internally on an empty stomach early in the
morning against stomachache. It is claimed that stom-
achache is caused due to cold weather.
The leaf extract showed slight analgesic activity
(Kumar et al., 1981) which may substantiate the tradi-
tional use of the plant as the soft tissues in the stomach
area may be prone to muscle cramps when the weather
gets cold. More tests should be conducted with the aer-
ial parts of the plant.
25. Rumex hastatus D. Don.; Polygonaceae; Bhanu-
mathi 21–96; Mallora; leaves.
The leaves are mixed with pudina (Mentha piperita
L.) leaves or the leaves alone are made into a paste,
diluted with water and taken internally early in the
morning on an empty stomach against stomachaches
due to gas.
Relevant tests should be conducted with Rumex has-
tatus.
Sometimes the leaves of R. hastatus were mixed
with pudina, Mentha piperita L. in the traditional treat-
ment. The leaves of M. piperata L. contains several
compounds (as discussed under the plant Oxalis cor-
niculata L.). Bacterial growth may be the reason for gas
formation in the stomach and can cause stomachaches.
The antibacterial and carminative properties of the
compounds present in M. piperita L. may give relief
from gas, thereby stomachaches, and only partially
explaining the traditional use. Further investigations
with the plant, R. hastatus alone are necessary.
26. Rumex nepalensis L.; Polygonaceae; Bhanumathi
41–96; Malera; leaves..
Leaves are made into a paste with water and applied
to boils which appear under the arm.
Relevant chemical and biological studies may be
necessary in order to verify the traditional use.
27. Salvia lanata Roxb.; Lamiaceae; Bhanumathi
33–96; Soong; whole plant.
The whole plant is made into a paste with water and
applied to burns.
From the essential oil of the ﬂower tops several con-
stituents of the triterpenoid type were identiﬁed (Sinha
et al., 1977). Some of these like citronellal, citral 1,8-
cineole, gerianiol, linalool and p-cymene possess anti-
septic, sedative, fungistatic and analgesic properties
(Harborne & Baxter, 1993, pp. 559–562). These prop-
erties may prevent infections. The analgesic and seda-
tive properties can give relief from pain or numb it.
Thus, the traditional use against burns may be
acclaimed. Further investigations should be conducted
with the whole plant in order to see if compounds that
can help against burns are present.
28. Sedum adenotrichum Wall; Crassulaceae; Bhanu-
mathi 1–96; Chichidi or kubiloo; leaves.
The leaves are made into a paste with water and
applied to boils. Boils are claimed to arise due to heat
which is often accompanied by itching. The treatment
is continued until symptoms dissappear.
So far no scientiﬁc investigations have been con-
ducted for the plant.
29. Thalaspi arvense L.; Cruciferae; Bhanumathi
24–96; Chaparu; leaves and seeds.
The leaves or seeds are made into a paste with water
and applied to swelling caused by the bite of mosquito.
This preparation is used mainly for children. The leaves
are preferred to seeds.
Neither chemical nor biological analyses have been

30. Thymus linearis Benth. ex Benth.; Lamiaceae;
Bhanumathi 23–96; Shakapar, Madroshad; aerial parts
and ﬂowers.
The aerial parts are chewed against swollen gums.
Dried aerial parts are rubbed into the palm greased
with ghee and the palm just shown over ﬁre. This is
then applied on to the back of babies to prevent colds.
Tea from the aerial parts is taken internally by adults
against chest congestion. Flowers are made into a paste
with some water and applied to boils.
Essential oil was extracted from the aerial parts of
ﬂowering plants/leaves, ﬂowers and the whole plant.
Compounds of the terpenoid and benzoid type were
found (Agarwal & Mathela, 1978; Mathela et al., 1980;
Avetisyan et al., 1988; Regnault-Roger, 1993). Some of
the compounds isolated were -terpineol, carvacrol,
citronellal, geraniol, linalool, 1,8-cineole and thymol
and these possess antiseptic properties (Harborne &
Baxter, 1993, pp. 558, 559, 560, 562, 567, 568). Car-
vacrol is also used in mouth wash, p-cymene is used as
a local analgesic (Harborne & Baxter, 1993, p. 561);
whereas limonene, citronellal and linalool possess
sedative activity. The properties of the above com-
pounds may take care of bacterial infection and pain
arising from swollen gums and boils.
Camphor (Harborne & Baxter, 1993, p. 558) has
been shown to possess antiviral activity. This property
could help in preventing cold in children. Chest con-
gestion may arise due to cold. Limonene (Harborne &
Baxter, 1993, p. 562) and 1,8-cineole possess expecto-
rant properties which could help against cough and get
rid of phlegm. In addition, analgesic properties of com-
pounds mentioned above may help in relieving dis-
comfort caused as a result of congestion of the chest.
All the traditional uses can be veriﬁed by the properties
of different compounds found in the plant.
31. Trifolium repens L.; Fabaceae; Bhanumathi 35–96;
Shaytu; roots.
The roots are made into a paste with water and
applied to boils for 1–2 days.
The roots should be a target of scientiﬁc investiga-
tions in order to explain the traditional use.
32. Urtica dioica L.; Urticaceae; Bhanumathi 36–96;
Kungsh; leaves
The leaves are pounded, boiled in water, ﬁltered and
stored. Two spoons of this extract is taken three times
a day against chest congestion.
The compounds caffeic, caffeic malic acid, ferrulic
and sinapic acids were found present in the
leaves/whole plant (Beschia et al., 1982; Obertries et
al., 1996) and have been shown to possess antiviral,
antibacterial and anti-inﬂammatory activities (Har-
borne & Baxter, 1993, pp. 474, 480, 487). Colds may
cause chest congestion and this may be due to micro-
bial infection. The properties of the above mentioned
compounds might help against congestion of the chest
by reducing the swelling of the mucous membranes
thereby easing breathing and hastening the cure.
Chest congestion can also occur due to asthma and
or allergic reactions. A freeze-dried preparation of the
herb, U. dioica, showed effectiveness in the treatment
of allergic rhinitis (Mittman, 1990). It might therefore
also relieve asthmatic symptoms thereby substantiating
traditional use.
33. Valeriana wallichi DC.; Valerianaceae; Bhanumathi
22–96; Neynu; roots
The rhizomes of the plant are pounded, mixed with
water and used as shampoo against itching of the scalp.
Tannins and saponins have been identiﬁed from the
rhizomes (Holzl, 1996; Bos et al., 1997).
Phenols and related compounds (tannic acid) are
widely used as antiseptics (Friedman, 1980). In cases
of dermatitis seborrheica limited to the scalp, itching
can occur. Hence, frequent shampooing would help.
The person may also scratch the scalp, thus causing
oozing which may lead to infections by microorgan-
isms easier. The antiseptic effect could therefore help
against microbial infections. It would also be helpful
against microbial infections of fungal nature, e.g., dan-
druff, thereby explaining the traditional use of the
plant.
From the rhizome and its essential oil several com-
pounds have been identiﬁed (Chari et al., 1977; Suri &
Thind, 1978; Pande & Shukla, 1993 a,b).
34. Viola canescens; Violaceae; Bhanumathi 5–96;
Banakash; ﬂowers.
The ﬂowers are fried in ghee and given to children
in order to reduce heat of the body. Adults eat the ﬂow-
ers as such for the same purpose.
Both chemical and biological analyses should be
undertaken with the ﬂowers of the plant.
CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION
The ethnobotanical and literature studies of 34 plants
in the study revealed that the traditional use of ten
plants could be substantiated. They are: Acorus cala-

mus, Anagallis arvensis, Elaegnus umbellata, Oxalis
corniculata, Plantago lanceolata, Rabdosia rugosa,
Roylea cinera, Salvia lanata, Thymus linearis, Urtica
dioica and Valeriana wallichi. The traditional uses of
the plants Ajuga bracteosa, Berberis lycium, Galium
aparine and Malva verticillata have only been partially
substantiated. For the plants Adiantum phillipense,
Bergenia stracheyi, Calamintha umbrosa, Campanula
colorata, Dermatocarpon miniatum, Juncus glaucus,
Persicaria capitata, Plagiochasma appendiculatum,
Potentilla supina, Prinsepia utilis, Ranunculus laelus,
Rhododendron arboreum, Rosa brunonii, Rumex has-
tatus, Rumex nepalensis, Sedum adenotrichum, Tha-
laspi arvense, Trifolium repens, Viola canescens, the
traditional uses have not been substantiated.
For the plants Oxalis corniculata and Rumex hasta-
tus the traditional use has been substantiated not by the
plant part itself but by the other substance, pudina or
Mentha piperita. For another plant, Malva verticillata,
black pepper, and sugar are used together with the
roots. The traditional use can be substantiated by black
pepper and not by M. verticillata. White pepper and
mustard oil have been used together with the plant
Ajuga bracteosa. Mustard oil is used together with the
leaf of the plant Plantago lanceolata. It is not clear as
to why the plant parts are mixed with another substance
in the traditional treatment. Further investigations are
necessary to see if any synergistic effect is responsible
in bringing about the above discussed traditional
effects.
There is an imminent danger that the knowledge of
medicinal plants possessed by the local women may be
lost. This is due to disappearance of species as well as
commercialisation that favours the need for a limited
number of species only. Therefore, there is an urgent
need to record this knowledge. Scientiﬁc investigations
should also be undertaken for many of the plants in the
study.
