    Garhwal Himalaya represents one of the richest zones of vegetational wealth
  in India. Pterid- 
    ophytic flora is also interesting in its diversity and distribution,
  however, little is worked out on 
    the economic aspects of these plants. Therefore, present communication
  pertains to the folk 
    utilization of ferns and fern-allies by the inhabitants of Deoprayag Tehsil
  in Garhwal Himalaya. 
    The studies are based on frequent field trips to various remote localities
  and collecting the 
    information from the local inhabitants. The perusal of literature indicated
  several little known 
    plants of folk utilization, and a large number of these could prove an
  important source of wider 
    economic utility after phytochemical analysis. 
    Key Words: Pteridophytes; edible ferns; medicinal ferns; fodder; manure;
  fire resistance; soil 
    binders. 
    Angiosperms of the Deoprayag and surround- 
    ing area of Garhwal Himalaya (78*--79 ~ longi- 
    tude, 29*--30* latitude) ofUttar Pradesh attracted 
    wide attention for taxonomic and economic bot- 
    any points. Pteridophyte plants in contrast have 
    received only limited attention (Gaur 1977; Gaur 
    and Semwal 1983; Gaur, Semwal, and Tiwari 
    1984; Gaur and Tiwari 1988). 
    Studies on fern and fern-allies in this region 
    have been carried out by several investigators 
    (Beddome 1883; Clarke 1880; Hope 1899; Du- 
    thie 1906) and others. More recently Bir et al. 
    (1983), Dhir and Sood (1981), Goel and Bhat- 
    tacharyya (1981), and Rau (1961) have contrib- 
    uted toward the understanding of the fern flora 
    of different quarters of Garhwal Himalaya. In 
    general there is little information on the ethno- 
    botanical and economic aspects of pteridophytic 
    plants from India, including the presently inves- 
    tigated area (Anonymous 1948-1976; Anony- 
    mous 1986; Jain 1991) and only a few scattered 
    economic reports are available (Bir et al. 1983; 
    Dagar and Dagar 1987; Dixit 1974; Dixit, Dad, 
    and Kar 1978; Islam 1983; Gaur and Semwal 
    1983; Kapur and Sarin 1977; Padala 1988; Purl

    1993. 
    and Puri 1970; Sharma and Vyas 1985; Singh 
    1973). Because fern and fern-allies are relatively 
    little known for their economic utilization, sev- 
    eral workers have emphasized this aspect of the 
    group (Aderkas 1984; Bir et al. 1983; Copeland 
    1942; Duke 1972; Harborne 1966; May 1978; 
    Padala 1988; Panvisavas, Worthen, and Bohw 
    1968; Strain and Cooper 1973; Tryon and Tryon 
    1982). 
    MATERIALS AND METHODS 
    Frequent field surveys were made during July 
    1986 to June 1989, covering various remote lo- 
    calities in different seasons. All the specimens 
    selected in the folk utilization were collected in 
    the field with the assistance of informants. From 
    the voucher plant specimens, the information on 
    folk utilization were gathered either from older 
    inhabitants, local medical practioners (Vedyas), 
    women folk or others. Usually the information 
    was verified by repeated queries from the local 
    inhabitants of different professions, ages and vil- 
    lages. The collected specimens are followed with 
    the usual methods of herbarium preparations 
    proposed by Jain and Rao (1977). The specimens 
    are identified from the voucher specimens of Bo- 
    tanical Survey of India, Northern Circle, Deh- 
    radun (BSD) and housed in the Herbarium Garh- 
    wal University (GUH).

    DISCUSSION 
    Our survey has revealed that ferns and fern- 
    allies are closely related to the lives of village 
    people, especially as food, fodder, manure and 
    medicines. Older inhabitants attest to their im- 
    portance in maintaining the deteriorating envi- 
    ronment. 
    Only a limited number of fern and fern-allies 
    are used for food (Aderkas 1984; Copeland 1942; 
    Komarov 1934; May 1978; Medsger 1939). Most 
    of the species are used as pot vegetables often 
    fried with animal fat or vegetable oil, rarely as 
    flavoring agents or pickled. Investigations in this 
    part of the Himalaya have disclosed some well 
    known edibles such as Diplazium polypodioides, 
    Dryopteris odontoloma, Nephrolepis cordifolia. 
    Young fronds of Ampelopteris prolifera, Dipla- 
    zium esculentum, Drynaria quercifolia, Dryop- 
    teris wallichiana and Pteridium aquilinum eaten 
    here are not much used in other parts of India 
    (Anonymous 1986). To make palatable prepa- 
    rations, the edible parts are boiled in water and 
    squeezed to remove toughness and toxic sub- 
    stances, as in Botrychium lanuginosum, Dipla- 
    zium esculentum and Nephrolepis cordifolia. 
    Leaves of Dryopteris odontoloma and D. wallich- 
    iana are dried in the sun and stored for use as 
    vegetable during periods of scarcity, although the 
    flavor is said to deteriorate in storage (Aderkas 
    1984). 
    Information on ferns and fern-allies in the 
    treatment of various ailments has been gathered 
    from the traditional practioners. There is uni- 
    formity in the remedial properties of different 
    plants, however, the dosage pattern is variable 
    subject to the experience and knowledge of med- 
    ical practitioners and the patient. The local prep- 
    arations are in crude form, such as fresh plant 
    paste for external applications; extract or juice is 
    applied without standard proportions of plant 
    material to water. For internal consumption de- 
    coctions or infusions of various concentrations 
    are used. In several preparations for internal con- 
    sumption, starchy water of cooked rice is added 
    with plant parts. 
    Some of the pteridophytes which are potential 
    drug sources, have been investigated phytochem- 
    ically, e.g., species of Adiantum, Botrychium, Eq- 
    uisetum, L ycopodium, Ophioglossum, Osmunda, 
    Pteridium and other genera (Gurung 1979; Har- 
    borne 1966; Newberne 1976; Panvisavas, Wor- 
    then, and Bohw 1968; Strain and Cooper 1973).

    are medicinally little known and could prove

    Preparation of green manure from fern and 
    fern-allies is a common practice in this region, 
    but has been little investigated. For this purpose, 
    fresh plant parts are laid as bedding for live- 
    stock, this material is partially deteriorated by 
    excretory products, frequently replaced, and ul- 
    timately stored in an open heap for final decom- 
    position to manure. Local populace use several 
    pteridophytes as palatable fodder for their live- 
    stock. Arthromeris wallichiana, Athyrium schim- 
    perL Diplazium polypodioides, Dryopteris wal- 
    lichiana, Pteridium aquilinum are much used for 
    this purpose. 
    Ampelopteris prolifera, Diplazium esculentum, 
    Drynaria quercifolia and Woodwardia unigem- 
    mata have the capacity to spread vigorously in 
    denuded areas, acting as soil binders. 
    Asplenium planicaule, Botrychium lanuginos-

    zium polypodioides, Dryopteris wallichiana, D. 
    odontoloma, Huperzia subulifolia, Nephrolepis 
    cordifolia and Pteridium aquilinum from wild 
    habitats are extensively used by local people for 
    various purposes, resulting in the depletion of 
    their population, suggesting the application of in 
    situ conservation methods.

    Boox REVIEW 
    The Gourd Book. Chafes B. Heiser, Jr. University of 
    Oklahoma Press, Norman, OK 73070. 1993. viii 
    + 248 pp. $16.95. (paperback edition of 1979 book). 
    ISBN 0-8061-2572-1. 
    When we learned of the recently published paper- 
    back version of Heiser's The Gourd Book, we greatly 
    appreciated receiving the book for review. Given the 
    age of the original hard-cover volume, we expected an 
    updated and expanded version of the original. How- 
    ever, aside from a 3-page "Preface to the Paperback 
    Edition" the paperback is merely a reprint of the 1979 
    publication. This is disappointing for, as Heiser points 
    out in the Preface, much has been learned in the past 
    15 years. Nomenclature has changed, old theories have 
    been revised, and new ethnobotanical and medicinal 
    studies have been performed. 
    Our initial disappointment aside, The Gourd Book 
    remains the most recent comprehensive volume on the 
    bottle gourd, Lagenaria siceraria (Cucurbitaceae). In 
    very readable and entertaining text, Heiser discusses 
    an interesting assortment of myths, uses, and dispersal 
    theories associated with this gourd species. The many 
    photographs and drawings, a few of which are in color, 
    themselves tell fascinating stories. 
    Although written to a lay audience, many gourd en- 
    thusiasts might be disappointed by the lack of detailed 
    information in Heiser's book on gourd culture and craft. 
    But given that a wealth of information on these topics 
    is available through publications of the American Gourd 
    Society, The Gourd Book strives instead to give its 
    readers a historical, ethnobotanical, and scientific per- 
    spective on one of our oldest cultivated plants. 
    Although most of the text is devoted to the bottle 
    gourd, there are chapters written about the other two 
    groups of commonly recognized gourds--species of 
    Cucurbita and the tree gourd, Crescentia cujete (Big- 
    noniaceae). Also included are chapters on various other 
    members of the Cucurbitaceae (e.g., Benincasa, Cu- 
    cumis, Luffa, Momordica, Trichosanthes). Although 
    most are not gourd-like in the sense of having a tough 
    rind, Heiser follows L. H. Bailey's lead in his Garden 
    of Gourds, 1937, of discussing cucurbits of ornamental 
    interest. 
    Anyone teaching a course having a general interest 
    in plants, ethnobotany, or origins of domestication 
    should have this publication in their library. For many 
    of us, the original 1979 edition was no longer available. 
    Now we have the opportunity to obtain once again the 
    "classic" book on gourds.

    Abstract
    Ethnobotanical use of plants is a part of the culture and civilisation of
  Darjeeling
    Himalaya. There are as many as 18 tribal communities who practice
  ethnobotany.
    Information data have been collected through extensive travel, meetings
  and
    discussions with the native tribes as well as through actual recording of
  usage. A
    herbarium of ethnobotanical plants has been set up in Kalimpong and a
  museum of
    ethnobotanical arts and crafts is being planned.
    Ethnobotanical information is ofgreat interest to pharmacological study
  while ethno-
    art and crafts display indigenous technology. Ethnobotany in this region
  can be
    developed into an instrument of socio-economic transformation of the poorer
  section of
    the people. Necessary measures are suggested.
    1, Introduction
    The Darjeeling Himalaya with a geographical area of 3,149 sq km and
  enjoying
    tropical, temperate and subalpine climate has a great biodiversity in its
  flora and contains
    many ethnobotanical information. Ethnobotanical study of about 6,000
  species ofplants
    found in the region has only recently begun. Contacts have been made with
  18 tribes in
    the region. They are the Lepchas, Bhutias, Sherpas, Yolmos, Drukpas,
  Tamangs,
    Gurungs, Mangars, Rais, Limboos, Newars, Oraons, Mechs, Santals, Totos,
  Thamis,
    Kagatays and Tibetans. All them harbour considerable ethnobotanical information
  of
    scientific and developmental importance.
    Countless plant species are used traditionally in many different manners
  and it has
    also been observed that the same plant species is also used for more than
  one purpose in
    different localities. The onslaught of modern way of easy life on the old
  tradition and
    access to alternative means has pushed the practice of ethnobotany to far
  flung rural
    villages where facilities of modern life are wanting. Meanwhile, it is
  quite certain that
    several valuable ethnobotanical informations have been lost with the
  passage oftime as
    there still lacks an organised attempt to document them and there are still
  no archives.
    Except for the plants used on occasions of festivals, worship, marriage and
  death rituals,
    those used as medicine and food need phytochemical analysis in order to
  ascertain their
    worth for wider use and benefit. It appears only a very small fraction of
  the available
    ethnobotanical wisdom has been recorded.
    2. Materials and Methods
    Visits were made to marketplaces (“haats” in local speech) to see and
  record the plants
    brought for sale by the villagers. Visits were also made to some ofthe
  rural homes to see

    the most indigenous ethnotechnology. Interview with herbalists and the
  patients who had been treated by them were done and the actual usage of
  plants recorded. Plants were identified and deposited at Kalimpong College
  Herbarium for further study.
    
    3. Results
    
    Yonzone et al. (1985a, b; 1984a, b) have already reported 118
  ethnomedicinal plants, 46 wild edible plants and 47 poisonous plants from
  Darjeeling Himalaya from their study on the natural resources of the region.
  The present paper deals with additional new cases and aspects, which have not
  been reported so far.
    
    Caradmine hirsuta Linn. (Cruciferae). "Simrayo" (N)*. Taken as
  any other vegetable for jaundice, heart disease, low blood pressure and
  gout.
    
    Capsicum frutescens Linn. (Solanaceae). "Dalley Khorsani” (N). Fruits
  used as spice and taken for gastric ailment.
    
    Daphne cannabina Hook. F. (Thymeliaceae). "Argeli” or “Kagatay” (N). A
  high quality insect-resistant paper is prepared from the bark of aerial parts
  through the traditional method. A remarkable feature is the eco-friendly
  method followed in manufacturing the paper, no chemicals being used. The
  paper locally called the "Paharay Kagach" is the most traditional
  paper of the folk. The plant coppices well and so a continued supply of the
  bark is ensured. The plant grows abundantly in the temperate Himalaya.
    
    Dicentra scandens (D.Don) Walpers (Fumariaceae). “Makuri Jhar" (N).
  The leaves of this climbing plant are used in cardiac ailment.
    
    Elsholtzia blanda Linn. (Lamiaceae). “Chhinik” (S), “Lenza” (N). The
  powdery seeds of this plant swell up and become sticky and mucilaginous when
  boiled; eaten as the "dal" (pulse soup), it is an important item in
  Indian food. The discovery of this new substitute for the pulse was made only
  a few years ago. The Sherpas of Darjeeling eat this as pulse extensively. The
  seeds of this plant are extremely light. About 250 grams of seeds of this
  plant provide the same amount of cooked “dal” as 1 kg of pulse seeds.
    
    Emblica officinalis Gaertn. (Euphorbiaceae). “Amala” (N). The fruit is
  eaten raw in indigestion and also improves the gums. A fine traditional
  pickle is prepared with the fruits.
    
    Equisetum diffusum D. Don (Equisetaceae). "Kurkuray Jhar" (N).
  The young shoots are crushed into a paste and this is applied directly for
  removal of skin warts or protuberances. Recently the juice extract has also
  been found to act as an effective biological pesticide.
    
    Gynocardia odorata R.Br. (Flacourtiaceae). "Gantay" (N). Oil from
  seeds used in leprosy and skin diseases. Fruits juice extract used as fish
  poison and also as a pesticide. Mahonia nepalensis DC. (Berberidaceae).
  “Chuttro” or “Kesari” (N). The ripe yellow berries are crushed in water and
  the filtrate taken orally in case of dysentery and urinary trouble.
    
    Oroxylum indicum Vent. (Bignoniaceae) "Totala" (N). The bark
  juice is taken in diabetes.
    
    Ophiopogon intermedius D. Don (Liliaceae). “Nakima" (N). The young
  inflorescence of the stemless plant with a cluster of leaves makes a fine
  curry.
    
    Rhododendron arboreum Smith (Ericaceae). "Rato Gurans" (N). Juice
  extract of young leaves is used to poison fishes. Flowers taken orally in
  case of blood dysentery and throat infections. A good quality wine is
  extracted from the flowers by a fermentation method.
    
    Solanum khasianum Clarke (Solanaceae). "Rambhenri kanra” (N). Smoke of
  seeds is applied to aching teeth.
    
    210
    Strobilanthes petiolaris Nees (Acanthaceae). "Sharpa Aushadhi
  Jhar" (N). The aerial leaves and stems made into a paste with water and
  applied to the point of snakebite and kept bandaged for several hours, cures
  snake bite.
    
    Thysanolaena maxima (Roxb.) O. Kuntze (Gramineae). "Kuchcho" (N).
  Root decoction in water is used for causing abortion and treatment of boils,
  mumps and abscesses. The plant has multifarious uses. It is ideal for
  preventing soil erosion over hill slopes by the plant's root system, the
  mature terminal inflorescences make the famous "broomstick", while
  the leaves are a good fodder for the cattle.
    
    Tagetes patula Linn. (Compositae). “Saipatri Phul” (N). A decoction of
  flowers in water is taken in case of fever and pneumonia. Grown commonly as a
  most favourite ornamental, the flowers find wide uses during festivals and
  ceremonies.
    
    Urtica dioica Linn. (Urticaceae). “Gharia Sishnu” (N). A delicious nettle
  soup is obtained from the young inflorescences boiled in water to which a
  little salt is added for taste. Often, a little flour is added to the
  consistency of thick soup.
    
    Zanthoxylum armatum DC. (Rutaceae). "Balay Timur" (N). The red
  fruits are eaten in the form of pickle in indigestion.

    4. Discussion
    
    The above examples are just the tip of an iceberg. An estimated 20% of
  rural people and 5% of the urban population still use traditional plant
  medicines for healing their diseases. Of the 118 plants species studied,
  their organic usage stands as follows:
    
    whole
    
    young shoots
    
    stems
    
    leaves
    
    roots
    
    10 species
    
    12 species
    
    24 species
    
    21 species
    
    22 species
    
    flowers
    
    fruits only
    
    8 species
    
    21 species.
    
    Investigation on the biochemical, pharmaceutical and pharmacological
  aspects of the above plants will help adjudge their potential as prospective
  economic crop for the farmers. The traditional agricultural system, which
  involves much overturning of the soil system through ploughing and digging is
  not promotive in checking the erosion of the valuable top soil. The
  traditional crops such as rice, maize, millet and wheat are also economically
  not viable. Hence, there is an urgent need to replace these staplecrops by
  environment-friendly high value cash crops such as the medicinal
  plants.
    
    Every plant needs to be regularly used so that it may not lose its
  importance and also may not get wiped out for being considered unimportant.
  The culture of ethnobotany can survive on the regular practice of the
  traditional use of these medicinal plants.
    
    The concept of ethno-agriculture and ethnofood is a part of ancient
  cultural heritage of the people. Ethnofood, which is found in several
  varieties all over the region, serves as an alternative to any modern food
  and is conveniently useful during times of famine or when it is difficult to
  buy modern food from the market. On the other hand, the following are the
  merits of ethno-agriculture:
    
    the farming being purely organic, no chemical fertilisers are used to
  increase soil fertility;
    
    there is a deep-rooted tradition to preserve sacred grooves of trees or
  other groups of plants;

    traditional food habit is still being sustained in large measure in the
  backward areas (in the modern sense of development);
    
    since agriculture is the only occupation and source of income and the
  people remaining content with this, such a situation leads to conservation of
  biodiversity people is generally not ambitious for more money and power
  gains.
    
    4.1. Conservation - need of the hour
    
    The establishment of genebanks at different phytogeographical ranges is the
  dire need of the hour. Yonzone (1993) reported that 29 species of plants and
  16 species of animals have become rare and endangered from Darjeeling hill
  region alone. Lack of environmental education, improper and often
  mismanagement of resources leading to unrestricted deforestation, failure to
  provide alternative resources and non-enforcement of environmental laws seem
  to be the chief reasons for this disaster. Ethnobotany is not only of
  cultural, scientific and academic interest but is also greatly of economic
  interest. The following approaches are emphasized for the development of
  ethnobotany:
    
    -
    
    - organizing village level workshops, training camps and awareness
  campaigns
    
    - demonstration and use of traditional plant products
    
    - providing financial assistance to promote ethnobotanical projects
    
    establishing ethnobotanical gardens, museums and even institutes
    
    setting up local, national and global networks for sale and purchase of
  ethnobotanical products
    
    - introducing ethnobotany as a full-fledged discipline in educational
  institutions, and
    
    - enacting laws for conservation of rare and important plants of
  ethnobotanical importance.

wild edible plants in the Sikkim Himalaya. Of 27 plant species that were analyzed for their 
nutritive values, 22 were edible for their fruits and five for leaves~shoots. Among different plant 
parts, generally higher nutrient concentration was recorded for leaves, followed by new shoots 
and fruits. For different species the crude fiber content ranged between 2.15-39.90%, and the 
total soluble salts between 4.66-21.0%, and the vitamin C content from 6-286 mg/lO0 g. The 
fat content was determined high in the fruits of Castanopsis species, Machilus edulis, and 
Cinnamomum species, while the protein content was highest in Hippophae rhamnoides, Cuc- 
umis melo, and Eleagnus latifolia. The total carbohydrate content ranged from 32-88% in the 
fruits of various wild edibles, the reducing sugar from 1.25-12.42%, total sugar from 2.10- 
25.09%, the lignin content varied from 9.05-39.51%, the hemicellulose between 25.63-55.71% 
and cellulose content varied from 9.57-33.19% in different species. Among the various mac- 
ronutrients estimated in the plant samples of different wild edible species, nitrogen was present 
in highest quantity, followed by potassium, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, and sodium. Mi- 
cronutrients, such as iron, zinc, magnesium, and copper contents were analyzed in different 
plant parts of various wild edible species. The iron content was higher in leaves and new 
shoots. The study shows that wild edible plants are good source of nutrient for rural population, 
and also well comparable with various commercial fruits. It is suggested that a few wild edible 
species need to be grown for commercial cultivation and adopted in the traditional agroforestry 
systems, which will lead to reduced pressure on them in natural forest stands as well as 
producing economic benefits for poor farmers.

India faced a series of famine and major food 
shortage before the 1940s. The national food 
grain production was merely 50.82 • 107 tons 
during 1950-1951, which has risen to 198.17 • 
107 tons in 1996-1997, thus increasing by three 
times in a span of four decades. At present the 
country is carrying a buffer stock of 36 • l07 
tons of food grain (Anonymous 1997). In addi- 
tion, there has been an increasing awareness 
about the nutritional status of the community 
particularly regarding young children and nurs- 
ing mothers during recent years. Nutrients de- 
rived from plants are important to human health

and complement other food sources (Abdoellah 
and Marten 1986; Sims and Peterkin 1987). The 
government of India is carrying out a large num- 
ber of programs for community development on 
a nutritional status to overcome the problem of 
malnutrition. In 1993 the government adopted a 
National Nutritional Policy, which can be con- 
sidered a significant achievement on the nutri- 
tion scene of the country. Through this program 
a National Plan of Action on Nutrition (NPAN) 
emerged in 1995 for different sectors of govern- 
ment to combat malnutrition. During 1960s and 
1970s various supplementary nutrition programs 
for pre-school children (Aganwadi), against ane- 
mia in women and nutritional blindness in chil- 
dren were launched. Malnutrition in children has

come down by 15% in 1975-1979 to 87% in 
1988-1990 (Anonymous 1997), which is re- 
markable by any standards. Despite food self- 
sufficiency at the national level, the country has 
not attained food security at a household level 
particularly in rural areas. A considerable pro- 
portion of rural population is still undernour- 
ished. People living in most of the rural and re- 
mote areas do not produce enough food grains 
to meet yearly food requirement and at times 
food supplies are not easily available. Therefore 
a large share of rural population is meeting their 
nutritional requirement through nonconventional 
means, by consuming various wild plants and 
animal resources (Singh and Arora 1978). Wild 
edible plants play a major role in meeting the 
nutritional requirement of the tribal population 
in remote parts of the country. A wide variety 
of plant leaves, fruits, roots, and other parts are 
collected from the wild and consumed by rural 
masses. In Sikkim Himalaya the natives con- 
sume nearly 190 such wild edible species (Sun- 
driyal 1999). Selection of a particular species for 
inclusion in the diet is location specific and in- 
fluenced by the availability of plant material. 
During recent years there has been 'a growing 
interest to evaluate various wild edible plants for 
their nutritional value (Arora and Pandey 1996; 
Bokhary et al. 1987; Bokhary and Parvez 1993, 
1995; Dhyani and Khali 1993; Franke 1982; 
Ifon and Bassir 1980; Maikhuri 1991; Maikhuri 
et al. 1994; Mazza 1995; Muthukrishnan and 
Abdul Khader 1990; Sadhu 1990; Singh et al. 
1967; Wesche-Ebeling et al. 1995). Neverthe- 
less, a careful examination of the literature re- 
veals that there are still a large number of wild 
edible species which are inexpensive and com- 
monly used by locals and whose nutritional po- 
tential have not yet been adequately studied. The 
present study examines the nutritional status of 
27 wild edible plants that are most commonly 
preferred and consumed in the Sikkim Himalaya 
and helps identify some potential species that 
can be included in traditional agriculture system 
based on their nutritional values. 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
Sikkim state falls in the eastern Himalayan 
zone of India (27~176 
N and 88058 "- 
88o55'25" E), covers 7096 km 2 area, and is 
bounded by Nepal on the west, by Tibet on the 
north, Bhutan and Tibet on the east, and Dar- 
jeeling district of West Bengal on the south. 
The state forms the entire upper catchment of 
the river Tista drainage system. The state is rich 
in cultural and biological diversity. Lepchas, 
Bhutias, Nepalese, and Limbus are main ethnic 
groups of Sikkim state and they differ from 
each other in their food habits, dresses, and liv- 
ing styles. Besides growing food grains, all in- 
digenous people collect large quantities of wild 
edible plants from natural habitats. A project 
was undertaken since 1994 until 1999 to iden- 
tify wild edible plants of the Sikkim Himalaya, 
their distribution, marketing, nutritive values, 
and multiplication of potential species for their 
adoption in the traditional agroforestry system 
of the state.

Detailed surveys were made of the villages, 
local markets, natural habitats, and formal and 
informal interviews conducted with the local 
people in different parts of the Sikkim Himalaya 
to gather information on the wild edible plants 
(Sundriyal 1999). Various wild edible species 
were collected and records were made on week- 
ly quantities available and retailers involved in 
the markets. For analyzing nutritive values, sam- 
ples of edible parts of various wild edible plants, 
which were healthy and free from any inflection, 
were collected from different forest stands as 
well as from the local markets when available. 
All samples were washed thoroughly to remove 
any attached soil and other impurities, and blot- 
ted dry. Thereafter all the samples were oven- 
dried at 60~ until constant weight. All the dried 
materials were ground separately to fine powder 
using a mixer/blender, sieved, and stored in an 
airtight container for nutrient analysis. For ana- 
lyzing nutrients where fresh samples are re- 
quired (e.g., acidity, vitamin C, TSS, etc), nutri- 
ent examinations were done within two days of 
the sample collection. 
Various recommended methods for analyses 
of nutrients in plant materials were used as given 
by Allen (1989), Anderson and Ingram (1993), 
AOAC (1984), and Rangana (1979). The quan- 
titative analysis of the fruit samples was broadly 
done for proximate analysis as well as ultimate 
analysis. The proximate analysis provides useful 
information, particularly from a nutritional and 
biochemical point of view, and constitutes pri- 
mary organic groups of the plant samples, e.g., 
fats, carbohydrates, proteins, sugars, fibers, ash, 
acidity, etc. It accounts for most of the organic 
dry matter of the foodstuff. The ultimate anal- 
ysis refers to the determination of a particular 
element (e.g., N, P, K, Ca, Mg, Na, etc.) or a 
compound present in the material (Allen 1989; 
Rangana 1979). Details of the procedures are 
provided by Sundriyal (1999), however, a brief 
presentation of various methods used in the 
analysis is given below. 
Proximate Nutrient Analysis. The ash content 
was determined by combusting the plant mate- 
rial in silica crucibles in a muffle fumace at 
550~ 
for three hours. Crude fiber was deter- 
mined by acid and alkaline digestion methods 
using Fibretec apparatus. Total Soluble Solids 
(TSS) content of fruits was measured through 
Hand Refrectrometer, while the acidity of fruit 
juices was determined by titration of a known 
weight of sample with NaOH using phenol- 
phthalein indicator. The value was calculated 
with reference to percent anhydrous citric acid. 
Ascorbic acid was determined through reduction 
method using a dye (2,6-dichlorophenol indo- 
phenol), which turns blue in alkaline solution 
and red in acid solution, and is reduced to a 
colorless form by ascorbic acid. Chlorophyll and 
anthocynin were estimated through calorimetric 
method. 
Crude fat in plant samples was determined by 
extracting a known weight of powdered plant 
material with petroleum ether using Soxhlet ap- 
paratus. The sugar content in the plant samples 
was estimated by determining the volume of un- 
known sugar solution required to completely re- 
duce a measured volume of Fehling's solution to 
red, insoluble cuprous oxide. Acid detergent lig- 
nin (ADL) was determined using Fibretec ap- 
paratus by de-fating a known weight of plant 
sample with acetone (cold extraction) and with 
acid detergent solution (hot extraction). Cellu- 
lose was determined by difference of acid de- 
tergent fiber minus acid detergent lignin. Hemi- 
cellulose was determined as the difference of 
neutral detergent fiber and acid detergent fiber. 
Determination of Minerals (Macronutrients). 
Nitrogen was determined through the micro- 
kjeldahl method by digesting a known weight of 
plant sample and treating it with alkali. The lib- 
erated ammonia is collected in boric acid and 
titrated with HC1. Phosphorus was estimated col- 
orimetrically by treating the digested sample 
with ammonium molybdate and freshly prepared 
ascorbic acid. Spectrophotometer apparatus was 
used to measure the absorbance at 880 nm. Po- 
tassium and sodium was determined through 
Flamephotometer. Calcium and magnesium in 
plant samples were determined by EDTA (the 
disodium salt of ethylene-diamine-tetra-acetic 
acid) titration method (Allen 1989; Anderson 
and Ingram 1984; Rangana 1979). 
Determination of Micronutrients. The micro- 
nutrients (Fe, Zn, Cu, Pb, Mn) were determined 
through the atomic absorption spectrophotome- 
ter method. The plant samples, which were di- 
gested in a tri-acid solution of HC104, HNO 3, 
and H2SO4, were passed through atomic absorp- 
tion spectrophotometer using different lamps, 
and calibrated for different micronutrients (Allen 
1989).

lected from different sources (compiled by Sun- 
driyal 1999) and data are provided in this paper 
for a comparison with the nutritive values of 
present study. 
RESULTS 
High diversity of wild edible plants has been 
recorded from the Sikkim Himalaya, which con- 
sisted a total of 190 species from 78 families 
and 143 genera, and all kinds of life forms (Ta- 
ble 1). Low to mid hills (<2000 m elevation) 
have a higher diversity of wild edible plants than 
the upper hill zone (>2000 m elevation). Wild 
edible species were consumed for various plant 
parts, i.e., fruit/seed (123 species), flower/buds 
(13 species), leaves/shoot (43 species), root/rhi- 
zome (6 species), and pulp or pith (Table 1). 
They were either eaten raw (mainly fruits), or

Most of the wild edible species were flowering 
plants, although a few other important ones be- 
long to lower groups of plants. Fruit was most 
common edible form at all elevations, though 
the numbers of species consumed for fruit pur- 
pose decreased with the elevation. A total of 48 
species were sold in three different local mar- 
kets, i.e., Namchi, Gangtok, and Singtam. The 
nutritive values were estimated for the 27 most 
prominent wild edible species that came to mar- 
ket after collection from natural habitats. The 
details of the nutritive values are presented in 
Tables 2 and 3. 
Proximate Nutrient Analysis. The moisture 
content was high (>80%) in the fruits of Cuc- 
umis melo, Eleagnus latifolia, Prunus ceraso- 
ides, Hippophae rhamnoides, Eriolobus indica, 
and Passiflora indica. Fruits of other species 
contained relatively lower moisture content (Ta- 
ble 2). The ash content in different wild edible 
species varied from 2.10-4.15%.

content was estimated highest in the fruits of 
Spondias axillaris, 
followed by Eriolobus 
indica, Baccaurea sapida, and Passiflora indica. 
The total soluble salts (TSS) determined for 
the fruits of various wild edible species varied 
from 4.66% (Machilus edulis) to 21.0% (Di- 
ploknema butyracea). Acidity in the fruits of dif- 
ferent species ranged between 0.29-5.54%. 
The vitamin C content was high in the fruits 
of Morus alba (286 mg/100 g), Baccaurea sap- 
ida (273.33 mg/100 g), and Hippophae rham- 
noides (263 mg/100 g) (Table 2). 
The chlorophyll content was also determined 
in the fruits of various wild edible species. 
Among fruits of various species, Spondias axil- 
laris and Hippophae rhamnoides recorded 0.861 
mg/g and 0.836 mg/g chlorophyll. Chlorophyll 
was recorded as 0.653 mg/g in the fruits of Man- 
gifera sylvetica and 0.519 mg/g in Bacaurea 
sapida (Table 2). The chlorophyll content was 
much lower in other species. The anthocyanin 
content in the pulp of various fruits was deter- 
mined to be highest in Baccaurea sapida and 
Rubus ellipticus. It was low in Machilus edulis 
and Eriolobus indica. Other species had inter- 
mediate range of anthocyanin (Table 2). 
Fats and Proteins. Fat content was determined 
high 
in 
the 
fruits 
of Castanopsis 
species 
(30.50%), followed by Machilus edulis (25.50%) 
and Cinnamomum species (21.50%). It was mod- 
erately high in the fruits of Hippophae rhamno- 
ides (9.33%) and Rubus ellipticus (7.10%). Low 
fat content was estimated in the fruits of other 
wild edible species (Table 2). Protein content was 
determined highest in the fruits of Hippophae 
rharnnoides (10.32%), Cucumis melo (8.29%), 
and Eleagnus latifolia (7.80%). The protein con- 
tent was low in Terminalia chebula and Eriolo- 
bus indica (Table 2). 
Carbohydrate, Sugars, Lignin, and Cellulose. 
The total carbohydrate content varied from 32- 
88% in the fruits of various wild edible species 
(Table 2). It was calculated highest in Morus 
alba, followed by Prunus cerasoides, Diplok- 
nema butyracea, Terminalia chebula, and Man- 
gifera indica. Lowest value of carbohydrate con- 
tent was calculated for Hippophae rhamnoides. 
Other species showed an intermediate range of

carbohydrate content. The reducing sugar and 
total sugar content in the fruits of various stud- 
ied species varied from 1.25-12.42% and 2.10- 
25.09%, respectively. The reducing sugar was 
determined highest in the fruits of Eriolobus 
indica, followed by Baccaurea sapida, Mangi- 
fera sylvetica, Passiflora indica, and Diplokne- 
ma butyracea. Fruits of other species contained 
a lower amount of reducing sugar. Total sugar 
content was high in the fruits of Cucumis melo, 
followed by Mangifera sylvetica, Eriolobus 
indica, and Passiflora indica. It was low in the 
fruits of Eleagnus latifolia, Machilus edulis, 
Terminalia chebula, and Spondias axillaris (Ta- 
ble 2). Lignin content varied from 9.05-39.51% 
in various fruits (Table 2). Low lignin content 
was determined in the fruits of Machilus edulis 
and it increased in Rubus ellipticus, Mangifera 
sylvetica, 
and Elaeocarpus sikkimensis, and 
reached a maximum in the fruits of Diploknema 
butyracea. Hemicellulose and cellulose contents 
of the fruits were estimated as 25.63-55.71% 
and 9.57-33.19%, respectively, in different spe- 
cies (Table 2). Hemicellulose was highest in the 
fruits of Spondias axillaris, while cellulose con- 
tent was determined as maximum in the fruits 
of Elaeocarpus sikkimensis. 
Mineral Contents. A total of 23 wild edible 
species consisting of edible fruits, leaves, and 
tender shoots were evaluated for their mineral 
contents. Among the various macronutrients, ni- 
trogen was present in highest quantity, followed 
by potassium, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, 
and sodium (Table 3). The nitrogen content var- 
ied from 0.02% (Terminalia chebula) to 4.10% 
(Agaricus sp.). Nitrogen content was also higher 
in the leaves of Diplazium esculantum and Ur- 
tica diocea (Table 3). The phosphorus content 
determined in various species varied from 
0.041-0.765% (Table 3). The highest phospho- 
rus content was determined in Agaricus sp., fol- 
lowed by Arisema utile (0.687%), Diplazium es- 
culantum (0.50%), and Pentapanax leschenaultii 
(0.477%). The potassium was determined high- 
est in shoots and new leaves of various species 
with a range of 1.87-2.40% (Table 3). The po- 
tassium content in the fruits of various wild ed- 
ible species ranged between 0.42 (Castanopsis 
species) to 
1.27% (Terrninalia chebula). In 
shoots and leaves of different species, the high- 
384 
ECONOMIC BOTANY 
[VOL. 55 
est potassium content was estimated for Arisema 
utile, followed by Diplazium esculantum, Agar- 
icus, Pantapanax leschenaultii, and Urtica di- 
ocea. The calcium content in different species 
was estimated highest in the fruiting bodies of 
Agaricus, fruits of Spondias axillaris, Eleagnus 
latifolia, and tender leaves/shoots of Urtica di- 
ocea and Diplazium esculantum. 
Micronutrients. Iron, zinc, magnesium, and 
copper contents were analyzed in different plant 
parts of various wild edible species. The iron 
content of various plants showed relatively high- 
er values in leaves and new shoots. Tender 
leaves/shoots of Urtica diocea was estimated 
having maximum iron content, followed by Ar- 
isema utile, Pantapanax leschenaultii, and Di- 
plazium esculantum (Table 3). The zinc content 
varied from 1490 txg/g (Pantapanax sp.) to 212 
txg/g (Prunus cerasoides) (Table 3). The mag- 
nesium (Mg) content ranged between 0.675- 
0.239% in different species, while the copper 
(Cu) content varied from 117 txg/g (Zanthoxy- 
lum sp.) to 11 txg/g (Prunus cerasoides) (Table 
3). 
The sodium (Na) content was highest in the 
fruits of Cucumis melo and it was estimated low- 
est in the fruits of Castanopsis species. The oth- 
er species showed intermediate range (Table 3). 
Comparison with Nutritive Values of Com- 
mercial Fruits. Nutritive values of some impor- 
tant and most commercial fruits are presented in 
Table 4 for comparison with the results of this 
investigation. The protein content ranged be- 
tween 0.20-21% and fat content between 0.10- 
64%. Fiber content of the commercial fruits 
(0.30-4.80%) was less in comparison to wild 
edible species. The carbohydrate content ranged 
from 7.60-67%, and vitamin C is reported be- 
tween 1.00-68 mg/100 g (Table 4). These values 
are comparable with our study. In this investi- 
gation the protein content was highest in the 
fruiting bodies of Agaricus, fruits of Prunus cer- 
asoides, fronds of Diplazium esculantum, young 
shoots of Arisema utile, and leaves of Pentapan- 
ax leschenaultii. These values are higher than 
the protein content of various commercial fruits, 
such as cashew (21%), almond (21%), and wal- 
nut (16%). The fiber content in the fruits of var- 
ious wild edible species ranged between 2.10- 
39.90%, which is high in comparison to various 
commercial fruits. Only three commercial fruit 
species had higher fat content than recorded in 
this study--walnut (64%), almond (59%), and 
cashew (47%). Among the different wild edible 
species, the highest fat content was recorded for 
Castanopsis species (30%), wild avocado Mach- 
ilus edulis (25.50%), and Cinnamomum species 
(21.00%), which is comparable with the fat con- 
tent of the commercial avocado Perkia ameri- 
cana. 
Comparison with Other Wild Edible Species. 
Table 5 represents the nutritive values of impor- 
tant wild edible species. It is clear from the table 
that few nutritive parameters have been reported 
for most of the species and there is a further 
need to cover more species with diverse param- 
eters for detailed nutritive values. The data rep- 
resent that wild edible species are good source 
of nutrients, particularly protein, carbohydrate, 
fat, vitamin C, and various other minerals. The 
nutritive values reported in Table 5 are well 
within the comparable range with data presented 
in Tables 2 and 3 for the Sikkim Himalaya. 
DISCUSSION 
Wild plants are gathered in the form of fruits, 
shoots, leaves, twigs, flowers, roots, tubers, 
stems, piths, etc., and these plants still share a 
good proportion of tribal dishes world over 
(Anonymous 1970-1988; Duke and Atchley 
1986; Neog and Mohan 1994; Samant and Dhar 
1997). Traditionally wild edible species have 
been meeting the protein, carbohydrate, fat, vi- 
tamin, and mineral requirement of the local res- 
idents to a greater extent (Sundriyal 1999). In 
the Himalaya, there are few studies that address 
the relationship of elemental content at the time 
of food consumption (Dhyani and Khali 1992, 
1993; Maikhuri 1991; Maikhuri et al. 1994; 
Negi 1991; Neog and Mohan 1994; Singh 1995). 
For most of the studies the fiber and protein con- 
tent are considered as the main determinan

Abstract
There are records of about 400 plants of therapeutic value in the Sikkim Himalaya. Indiscriminate and non-systematic collection
of medicinal plants has led to severe pressure on the availability of these plants, many of which are now rare, threatened or
endangered. Six species, are taken as a case study, viz. Aconitum heterophyllum (Wall), Podophyllum hexandrum (Royle), Nardos-
tachys jatamansi (DC), Picrorhiza kurrooa (Benth), Swertia chirata (Ham) and Bergenia ciliata (Har.) Stenb. The number of plants
collected from the wild in Sikkim are very high (c. 800,000 A. heterophyllum; 7,700,000 N. jatamansi; 3,100,000 P. kurrooa, and
3,000,000 S. chirata). The six species studied are considered as test cases for successful conservation for the large number of species
in Sikkim that are claimed to have therapeutic value and whose survival in the wild is threatened. # 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

1. Introduction
In the Himalayan region the use of plants to cure/
abate certain ailments and disease is an age-old practice
starting from a situation when life-saving herbs from the
wild provided the only refuge during emergency and
trauma. The most ancient Indian system of Ayurvedic
medicine goes back to 1000 BC. A great many of these
traditional medicinal plants have found their way as raw
materials into modern bio-pharmaceuticals and bio-
cosmetic industries in recent times. The World Health
Organization has estimated that about 4000 million
people rely on herbal medicines and 25% of prescrip-
tion drugs are based on plant-derived chemicals.
Careful exploitation of medicinal plants growing in
mountain regions provide an opportunity for local
development (Purohit, 1997). Earlier, such herbals were
used only by local people in small quantities but com-
mercialization of some species in recent years has
increased their demands and consequent exploitation.
Heavy extraction of these plants from the wild, loss of
habitat by deforestation and excessive grazing pressure
in high altitude pastures in the entire Himalayan region
now threaten their survival.
Sikkim remained largely unexplored for a consider-
able period in history because of its geography, but
from the middle of the 18th Century AD visits by nat-
uralists and explorers exposed its biological wealth. It is
now known as a biological `Hot Spot' and about 5000
species of ¯owering plants are found in the 7096 km2
area (Hajra and Verma, 1996). The ®rst ¯oristic study of
the Sikkim Himalaya was by J.D. Hooker (1871±1897),
and this was followed by a comprehensive work on
medicinal plants of Darjeeling and Sikkim by Biswas
(1956). Over 400 plants possessing therapeutic proper-
ties have been recorded from the region (Srivastava and
Kapaki, 1990). Studies on the status, uses and potentials
of 40 important medicinal plants of the Sikkim Hima-
laya were made by Rai and Sharma (1994). Many uses
of Sikkim's medicinal plants in Ayurvedic and Tibetan
medicines, their status and cultivation techniques have
been carefully recorded (Nautiyal, 1995; Sharma, et al.
1995; Singh, 1995; Trogawa et al., 1995; Tsarong, 1995).
Six important species of medicinal plants have been
selected for a study of conservation threats in Sikkim.
This paper deals with the distribution, usage, harvest
pressure and threats concerning Aconitum heterophyllum
(Wall),
Nardostachys
jatamansi
(DC),
Podophyllum
hexandrum (Royle), Picrorhiza kurrooa (Benth), Swertia
chirata (Ham) and Bergenia ciliata (Har) Stenb. The
®rst four species are endangered (Nayar and Sastry,
1990). These selected species are considered as test cases

value and whose survival in the wild is threatened.
2. Sikkim Himalaya
Sikkim Himalaya is de®ned by the great drainage
region of the river Tista that constitutes the hills of Sikkim
and Darjeeling district of West Bengal in the eastern
Himalaya. The hills of Sikkim (7096 km2) and Darjeeling
(3149 km2) range altitudinally from 100 m a.s.l. (foot-
hills) through 4000 m (timberline) up to 8548 m (Mt.
Khangchendzonga). The area thus covers several ecolo-
gical zones viz., subtropical, temperate, sub-alpine and
alpine. In such a small area sharp climatic dierences in
dierent ecological zones have promoted a rich ¯ora.
Sikkim Himalaya is also a cornucopia of ethnicity
having four major groups, Bhutias, Lepchas, Limbus
and Nepalese, and a conglomerate of over 20 ethnic
tribes and even more sub-tribes. The medicinal plants
here are extracted by the local people for ethnic medic-
inal use, for use in Ayurvedic and Tibetan medicines
and also for use in modern bio-pharmaceuticals and
bio-cosmetics. The distribution of the selected six med-
icinal plants is presented in Fig. 1. Swertia chirata
occurs at middle altitude while the other ®ve species
grow at high altitudes.
3. Distribution and usage
3.1. Aconitum heterophyllum (Wall) (Ranunculaceae)
An erect, rarely twining, herb distributed in the tem-
perate Himalaya between Kashmir to Sikkim and fur-
ther east to Myanmar. In the Sikkim Himalaya it is
found around 3500 m. The dried root is used generally for
fever and body pain. It is also used as alterative, dia-
phoretic, diuretic, expectorant, febrifuge and diapepsiac.
3.2. Podophyllum hexandrum (Royle) (Berberidaceae)
A succulent erect herb distributed in the Himalaya
from Afghanistan and south-west China. In the Sikkim
Himalaya it grows between 3600 and 4800 m a.s.l. The
roots are used as emetic, cholagogue, vermifuge, purga-
tive, alterative and blood puri®er. The roots contain
podophyllotoxin, which has been reported as anti-
cancerous (Arnold, 1979).
3.3. Nardostachys jatamansi (DC) (Valerianaceae)
A herb growing up to 20 cm in height. It is found in the
Himalaya between Kumaon and Sikkim. In the Sikkim
Himalaya it is found at an elevation of 3600±4800 m.
The roots are used generally as a stimulant and anti-
spasmodic. Murty and Subramanyam (1989) cited many
other uses such as diuretic and anticonvulsant, and used
in epilepsy, hysteria, heart palpitation and cholera.
Roots are reported to be rich in terpenoids (Wargner
and Jurick, 1979).
3.4. Swertia chirata (Ham) (Gentianaceae)
A slender, upright herb occurring in the Himalaya
from Kashmir to Bhutan and Khasi hills. In the Sikkim
Himalaya it is found between 1600 and 2600 m a.s.l.
The whole plant contains gentiamine alkaloids and the
aerial part contains xanthones (Sharma, 1982). The
water extract of the plant is generally used during fever.
Other uses are in bronchial asthma, dyspepsia and
debility. It is a favourite remedy in intermittent fevers,
acidity and in bilious dyspepsia accompanied by fever.
3.5. Bergenia ciliata (Har) Stenb. (Saxifragaceae)
A creeping herb with rhizomes. It occurs commonly
throughout temperate Himalaya between 1500 and 3000
m. The rhizome is used to cure diarrhea and vomiting.
It is also used against fever, coughs and pulmonary
infections, for boils and as an antiscorbic.
3.6. Picrorhiza kurrooa (Benth) (Scrophulariaceae)
A creeping herb found between Kashmir and Sikkim
above 4000 m. Its roots are used as a tonic, cathartic,
stomachic and purgative. It is also used in fever, dys-
pepsia
and
scorpion
stings.
Glycosides,
especially
picroside and kutkoside, are the chief bioactive phyto-
chemicals of its roots (Aswal et al., 1984).
4. Conservation threats
So far all the medicinal plants that reach the common
market are collected from the wild state. The majority
of
traders
collect
wild
medicinal
plants
through
untrained and unskilled labourers. This is generally in
the form of extraction of the entire plants, roots, rhi-
zomes, tubers and bulbs before seed set, making low
regeneration of the species in the habitat. Over-exploi-
tation of these species, as well as trampling at particular
places during collection has changed the habitat condi-
tions causing a gradual loss of other associated species.
The market stock of medicinal plants comes from
private collectors and suppliers with legal permits for
collection of herbs from speci®c collection sites. These
sites are demarcated and collection permits issued by
the Forest Department, Government of Sikkim. Major
medicinal herbs are scattered throughout the region,
but some sites are identi®ed for pro®table collection.
28
L.K. Rai et al. / Biological Conservation 93 (2000) 27±33
A collection cycle is maintained every year under rota-
tion so that the same sites are not exploited repeatedly.
Although this system has de®nite bene®t to the con-
servation of these herbals it is not strictly followed.
Absence of forest ocials at remote sites allows collec-
tors to enter sites other than the demarcated ones and
there is a great deal of illegal collecting that cannot be
measured from market investigations.
The collection season for the major species is shown
in Fig. 2, and the major collection sites are cited in
Table 1. After collection all the materials are brought to
the respective road-heads and then transported to the
markets at Gangtok, Siliguri, Kalimpong and other
destinations such as Calcutta and New Delhi. The
pricing and transaction of amount involved is kept
strictly secret. Even the actual destination of the

shipment is not known as dealers maintain a guarded
attitude towards relevant inquiries.
A general herbal inventory from a typical jadi-buti
salesman is presented in Table 2. The ®nal product may
be sold as raw, unprocessed or under-processed (in the
form of twigs, leaves, barks, roots and rhizomes) or in
the form of processed powder, crude tablets or syrups.
In general, the plant parts suitable for the marketing
purpose increase with maturity; one can get better eco-
nomic returns with the fully matured plants and this is
dictated by a regular market demand. However, most of
these species take 7±8 years to attain full maturity and
to become economically viable (Nautiyal, 1995), which
can severely test the patience of herbal farmers. The
resultant option, thus remains, direct collection of the
herbs from the wild state. The amount collected for a
calendar year from the dierent collection centres in
Sikkim is given in Table 1. Comparison of collections
and harvesting pressures in Sikkim and Nepal clearly
shows that the situation is even worse in Nepal, espe-
cially for P. kurrooa and S. chirata (Table 3). The
extraction pressure, in terms of number of plants, for a
single calendar year is very high for almost all the spe-
cies. Average yields are given in Table 4. This shows the
approximate number of plants which are required
(shoot or root dry mass) to produce 1 kg of medicinal
part. A. heterophyllum, for example requires a total of
75 plants uprooted from the nature to realize 1 kg.
Likewise, plant numbers required for every kilogram are
highest in P. kurrooa followed by N. jatamansi, S. chir-
ata, B. ciliata and lowest in P. hexandrum. Except for
S. chirata only the underground parts are marketable.

In any case the volume of biomass taken out every year
from the wild state in the form of medicinal herbs has
been quite remarkable. Total plant numbers harvested
annually from Sikkim is given in Table 4. These num-
bers are very high and suggest heavy harvesting pressure
on their natural habitats indicating a high and steady
biomass loss every year.
5. Conservation initiatives
In the Sikkim Himalaya, research and development
on conservation of medicinal plants are being carried
out by the G.B. Pant Institute of Himalayan Environ-
ment and Development, the Forest Department and
other agencies (Table 5). Propagation techniques for
Aconitum,
Picrorhiza
and
Podophyllum
have
been
developed using seeds or cuttings of stems, stolons,
tubers and rhizomes (Nautiyal, 1995). The Forest and
Horticulture Departments have established a nursery
for growing high altitude medicinal plants, but sus-
tained cropping has not yet been successfully achieved.
So far, no local agencies have taken measures for
systematic cultivation and marketing of these herbs.
However, works on protection, conservation and man-
agement, along with an awareness drive among medic-
inal plant collectors, have been initiated by the Forest
Department. A policy of rotational harvesting from
demarcated areas through permits allows recuperation
and a sustainable harvest. Most of the medicinal plants
occur in restricted areas of the state and collection per-
mits are only issued to local inhabitants. This has
restrained collectors from outside the area who are
normally very numerous in the central Himalaya. The
Forest Department has also been planting some of these
medicinal plants back into natural habitats to see whe-
ther sustainable harvesting in demarcated areas can
meet the requirements for traditional use. The remain-
ing areas in the wild should be set aside for in situ
conservation by banning exploitation there. Another

possible approach is through community involvement in
sustainable use. An enterprise at Humla in Nepal pro-
vides a success story for conserving N. jatamansi and its
habitat. Local people harvest the roots of this species
from nearby alpine meadows using minimum dis-
turbance and taking only the largest plants, process
them on-site and export the oil through the Humla
Conservation and Development Association (Biodi-
versity Conservation Network, 1997).
